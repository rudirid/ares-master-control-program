## SOLUTION SKETCH (AFTER DISCOVERY)

"Okay, here's what I'd implement for The 99 People specifically:

**Phase 1: AI Phone Answering + Lead Capture**
- Never miss a call (24/7 answering)
- Captures customer info, job type, urgency
- Auto-sends you notification with details
- Integrates with [their current tool]

**Phase 2: Automated Scheduling**
- Booking requests go straight into your system
- Auto-checks tech availability
- Sends confirmation to customer
- Updates your job management tool

**Phase 3: Real-Time Route Optimization**
- Techs get optimized route on their phone
- When emergency job comes in, system finds closest tech
- Reduces drive time by 30-50%

**Price Range:** $6K-$8K depending on complexity

**Payback:** 3-4 weeks based on your numbers

**Implementation Time:** 2-3 weeks, need about 3 hours of your time total

**Support:** I'm available ongoing if anything breaks"

---

## OBJECTION REFRAMES (IF NEEDED)

### "How much is this going to cost?"
"Let's figure out what the problem is costing you first. [Show ROI calc above]. If implementation is $6K and saves you $X/month ongoing, that's a X-week payback. Make sense?"

### "My techs won't use new tech"
"They already use smartphones. We just send them job addresses automatically instead of you texting them. Actually simpler for them than what they do now."

### "I'm too busy to implement right now"
"That's exactly why you need this. You're busy BECAUSE you're doing everything manually. I need 3 hours of your time upfront, I handle the rest. That 3 hours gets you 10-20 hours back per week forever."

### "What if it breaks?"
"I use this exact system in Ki Landscapes. If it breaks, I feel it too. I'm not handing you software and disappearing - I support it ongoing. Plus we build on top of [his tool], not replace it, so worst case you still have your current system."

### "Let me think about it"
**Dig deeper:** "What specifically do you need to think about - the price, whether it'll work, timing, or something else?"

---

## NEXT STEPS

### If YES:
"Awesome. I'll put together a detailed proposal with exact pricing, timeline, and what you get in each phase. When should I get that to you - end of week?"

**Set follow-up date:** ________________

---

### If "LET ME THINK":
"Totally fair. Before you go - what specifically do you need to think about?"

**Real objection:** ________________

**Address it:** ________________

**Set specific follow-up:** "How about I check in with you Friday - does that work?"

---

### If NO:
"No worries at all. What's the main reason it doesn't fit right now?"

**Decline reason:** ________________

**Provide value:** [Resource, referral, or insight]

**Reconnect date:** "Let's stay in touch. When should I check back in - 3 months, 6 months?"

---

## PROOF POINTS (Use if needed)

- **Ki Landscapes:** Using AI phone answering, saves 8 hours/week, haven't missed a call in 3 months
- **Asah Homes:** Built construction business from scratch using these exact systems
- **Beta clients:** [When you have them] - [Name] at [Business] increased captured leads by X%

---

## POST-CALL: IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

- [ ] Update notes above into structured format
- [ ] Calculate exact ROI with his numbers
- [ ] Decide: Proposal, Follow-up, or Decline
- [ ] Add to pipeline tracking (active-leads.yaml or other)

---

**REMEMBER:**
- Strong relationship = be direct, challenge him, joke around
- Let him talk (80/20 rule - he talks 80%)
- Listen for emotional language ("nightmare", "killing me") = urgency
- Don't pitch until you understand the full problem
- Do the math live with him (more powerful than doing it later)

**YOU'VE GOT THIS.**

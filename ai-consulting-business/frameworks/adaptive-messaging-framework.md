# ADAPTIVE MESSAGING FRAMEWORK
## Context-Driven Communication Templates

**CRITICAL:** These are NOT copy-paste scripts. They are frameworks that adapt based on:
- Client context (relationship type, business stage, pain points)
- Information gathered during discovery
- Rio's authentic voice
- Proven sales psychology principles

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: CONTEXT > TEMPLATES

**Bad Approach:**
Send same message to everyone, change name only.

**Good Approach:**
Use framework + client context to craft personalized message.

**Framework Components:**
1. **Hook** - Why this matters to THEM specifically
2. **Credibility** - Why Rio can help
3. **Offer** - What they get
4. **Easy Yes** - Low-friction next step

---

## OUTREACH FRAMEWORK 1: WARM NETWORK

### When to Use
- Existing relationships (Chamber, BNI, suppliers, past colleagues)
- Rio knows them personally or through shared connection
- They've expressed interest in business systems/automation

### Framework Structure

**Step 1: Personalize the Hook**
Pull from what you know about them:
- Recent conversation topic?
- Business challenge they mentioned?
- Shared experience?
- Mutual connection?

**Examples:**
- "Remember when you mentioned you're drowning in admin at the last Chamber meeting?"
- "Saw your post about hiring struggles—reminded me of something I've been working on"
- "After our chat about scaling [business name], I built something that might help"

**Step 2: Bridge to Your Solution**
Connect their problem to what you're doing.

**Formula:** [Their problem] → [Your experience solving it] → [Offering to help them]

**Examples:**
- "I had the same problem at Ki Landscapes—was working 70-hour weeks. Built some AI systems that got me down to 45 hours. Game-changer."
- "I've automated a bunch of my own chaos and honestly, saved like 15 hours a week. Pretty wild."

**Step 3: Beta Program Positioning**
Why it's free, what you need.

**Formula:** "I'm doing [X beta runs] to [refine process]. You'd be perfect because [specific reason]. Here's what I'm thinking..."

**Key Elements:**
- Scarcity (limited spots)
- Reciprocity (free value for them)
- Specificity (why THEM specifically)
- No pressure (but clear expectation)

**Step 4: Simple Next Step**
Don't make them work.

**Good Next Steps:**
- "Keen? I'll send some prep questions and we can chat next week."
- "Interested? Let me know and I'll shoot over more details."
- "Sound relevant? Happy to walk you through what I'm thinking."

**Bad Next Steps:**
- "Let me know if you're interested"(too vague)
- "Check out my website" (too much friction)
- "Can we schedule a call?" (too formal for warm network)

### Adaptive Variables to Consider

**Relationship Strength:**
- **Strong (close friend/regular contact):** Very casual, can be direct
  - "Mate, I'm building something you need. Let's chat."
- **Medium (acquaintance, Chamber member):** Friendly but professional
  - "Hey [Name], been thinking about our last conversation..."
- **Weak (met once, mutual connection):** More formal, need credibility
  - "Hi [Name], we met at [event]. [Mutual friend] suggested I reach out..."

**Their Current State:**
- **Expressed problem recently:** Reference it specifically
- **Successful/scaling:** Position as "keep your edge" not "fix your broken stuff"
- **Struggling:** Empathy first, solution second

**Your Relationship to Their Industry:**
- **Same industry (trades):** "I know exactly what you're dealing with..."
- **Adjacent industry:** "Different business, same operational chaos..."
- **Different industry:** Focus on universal problems (admin, time, systems)

### Example Adaptive Message

**Context:**
- Name: Sarah
- Relationship: Chamber of Commerce acquaintance, met 3 times
- Business: Cleaning services, ~$600K revenue, 12 staff
- Recent: Mentioned at last Chamber meeting she can't take holidays
- Stage: Clearly Stage 2

**Message:**
```
Hey Sarah,

After the Chamber meeting last week, I kept thinking about what you said—not being able to take holidays without everything falling apart. I've been there with Ki Landscapes, it's brutal.

Over the past few months, I've been building AI systems to automate a lot of the chaos in my own businesses. Properly saved me 15+ hours a week on stuff that used to drive me mental.

I'm turning this into a service now, targeting businesses like yours (cleaning, trades, home services) who are stuck working IN the business instead of ON it.

I want to do 3-5 beta runs before I go full market, and you'd be perfect—you're at that stage where systems would make a huge difference, plus you actually WANT to improve (not everyone does).

Here's what I'm thinking:
- 90-min deep dive into your ops (what's working, what's broken, where things fall through cracks)
- Custom AI roadmap specific to your cleaning business
- I implement one project for you—something that'll actually save you time or make you money
- All free. I just need honest feedback and a video testimonial if it works.

If you see ROI, we can talk about doing more. But no pressure if the timing's not right.

Keen? I'll send over some prep questions and we can chat next week.

Cheers,
Rio
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ References specific conversation (personal touch)
- ✅ Shows empathy ("I've been there")
- ✅ Proves credibility (own businesses)
- ✅ Specific to her industry (cleaning, not generic)
- ✅ Clear what she gets
- ✅ Easy next step

---

## OUTREACH FRAMEWORK 2: CONTENT-DRIVEN INBOUND

### When to Use
- Someone engages with your LinkedIn/Facebook content
- They comment, like, or DM about a post
- Warm-ish lead from public visibility

### Framework Structure

**Step 1: Acknowledge Their Engagement**
Reference what they said/did.

**Examples:**
- "Saw your comment on my LinkedIn post about [topic]—glad it resonated"
- "Thanks for the DM about [topic]. You mentioned you're dealing with [problem]..."
- "Appreciate you sharing that post. Sounds like you're in a similar boat?"

**Step 2: Qualify Quickly**
Not everyone who engages is a fit. Ask diagnostic question.

**Examples:**
- "Out of curiosity, what does your operation look like? (Revenue, team size, etc.)"
- "What's your biggest operational headache right now?"
- "Are you actively looking to solve this or just gathering info?"

**Step 3: If They're Qualified → Beta Offer**
Similar to warm network, but shorter (they're less warm).

**Step 4: If Not Qualified → Stay Connected**
Don't burn bridge. Offer to reconnect when timing's right.

**Examples:**
- "Sounds like you're in Stage 1—bit early for automation. Let's reconnect when you hit $250K. I'll keep sharing what I learn."
- "You're further along than my sweet spot—I'd refer you to [enterprise vendor]. But happy to stay connected."

### Adaptive Variables

**Engagement Type:**
- **Detailed comment:** They're thinking deeply, qualify them
- **Generic "great post":** Polite acknowledgment, don't chase
- **DM with specific question:** High intent, respond thoroughly

**Content Topic:**
- If they engaged with "building in public" content → Curious about process
- If they engaged with "pain point" content → Experiencing that pain
- If they engaged with "case study" content → Results-oriented, show ROI

### Example Adaptive Response

**Context:**
- Name: Marcus
- Engagement: Commented on LinkedIn post about route optimization saving 10 hours/week
- Comment: "Man, I need this. My guys are all over the place."
- Unknown business details

**Response:**
```
Hey Marcus,

Saw your comment on the route optimization post—"my guys are all over the place" hits home. That was Ki Landscapes 6 months ago.

Out of curiosity, what does your operation look like? (Industry, team size, rough revenue?)

Asking because I'm doing a few beta implementations right now for home services businesses, and route optimization is one of the quick wins that actually moves the needle.

If you're in the $250K-$1M range with multiple crews, you'd be perfect. Happy to chat about what I built and whether it'd work for your setup.

Shoot me a DM or reply here with some context and we can take it from there.

Cheers,
Rio
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Acknowledges engagement
- ✅ Qualifies before pitching
- ✅ Specific criteria (not wasting time)
- ✅ Low-pressure next step

## DISCOVERY CALL PREP FRAMEWORK

### When to Use
- Beta client confirmed for discovery call
- Need to send prep questions 2-3 days before call

### Framework: Chris Voss Tactical Empathy + CIA Elicitation

**Core Principles:**
1. **Open-ended questions** - Can't answer with yes/no
2. **Calibrated questions** - Start with "What" or "How", not "Why"
3. **Mirroring** - Repeat last 3 words to get them talking more
4. **Labeling** - "It seems like..." or "It sounds like..."
5. **Tactical empathy** - Understand their world before solving

**Goal:**
Get them to self-diagnose their problems in detail BEFORE the call.

### Adaptive Question Bank

**Always Ask (Universal):**
1. "What's taking up most of your time each week that you wish you could delegate or automate?"
   - *Why*: Reveals time sinks, indicates priorities

2. "Where are things currently falling through the cracks in your business?"
   - *Why*: Shows operational gaps without making them feel bad

3. "What's the biggest bottleneck preventing you from [stage-appropriate goal]?"
   - Stage 2: "...getting to consistent $100K months"
   - Stage 3: "...scaling past $2M"
   - *Why*: Focuses on growth constraint

**Stage-Specific Questions:**

**For Stage 2 Clients:**
- "How many jobs do you complete per week, and how many leads do you get?"
  - *Why*: Reveals conversion rate, capacity

- "Can you take a 2-week holiday without checking in? What would break if you did?"
  - *Why*: Reveals owner dependency

- "What systems/software are you currently using?"
  - *Why*: Shows tech-readiness, integration needs

**For Stage 3 Clients:**
- "How do you ensure consistent quality across all your crews/teams?"
  - *Why*: Reveals process maturity

- "What visibility do you have into daily operations? How do you know what's happening?"
  - *Why*: Shows reporting gaps

- "Where are you hitting capacity constraints that prevent scaling further?"
  - *Why*: Identifies growth blocker

**Industry-Specific Questions:**

**For Trade/Field Services:**
- "How much time do your techs spend driving vs. on actual jobs?"
  - *Why*: Route optimization opportunity

- "How do you currently handle scheduling and dispatch?"
  - *Why*: Workflow understanding

**For Cleaning Services:**
- "What's your process for handling recurring clients vs. one-offs?"
  - *Why*: Subscription optimization opportunity

- "How do you track which staff cleaned which properties?"
  - *Why*: Quality control needs

**For Pest Control:**
- "How do you manage compliance tracking for different service types?"
  - *Why*: Regulatory automation opportunity

### Adaptive Prep Email Template

**Context Variables to Pull:**
- {name}
- {business_name}
- {industry}
- {stage}
- {primary_pain_mentioned}

**Template:**
```
Hey {name},

To make the best use of our time, can you answer these questions before we chat? (Just reply to this email, doesn't need to be formal)

[Include 5-7 questions from question bank above, customized to their context]

1. [Stage-appropriate question]
2. [Industry-specific question]
3. [Universal question about time]
4. [Universal question about pain points]

## POST-CALL FOLLOW-UP FRAMEWORK

### When to Use
- Within 24 hours of discovery call
- Summarize understanding, confirm next steps

### Framework Structure

**Part 1: Recap What You Heard**
Demonstrate you listened + understood.

**Formula:**
"Here's what I heard: [their 3 biggest problems]. Sound right?"

**Part 2: Confirm The Plan**
What you agreed to build, timeline, what you need from them.

**Formula:**
"Here's what we agreed:
- I'll build [specific solution]
- Timeline: [X weeks]
- You'll provide: [access/info needed]
- Success looks like: [measurable outcome]"

**Part 3: Immediate Next Step**
What happens now.

**Examples:**
- "First step: I need access to [system]. Can you add me as [role]?"
- "I'll send over the beta agreement for signature—just formalizes what we discussed"
- "I'll start scoping this week and check in with you Friday with initial design"

### Example Adaptive Follow-Up

**Context:**
- Client: Daren (pest control/air con)
- Stage: Stage 3 ($5-10M revenue)
- Primary Problem: Phone answering + booking coordination
- Secondary: Route optimization for growing team
- Agreed Solution: Start with phone/booking automation

**Email:**
```
Hey Daren,

Great chatting today. Here's what I heard:

Your biggest bottlenecks right now:
1. Phone answering—calls getting missed or taking too long to convert to bookings
2. Booking coordination—currently manual between phone and ServiceM8
3. Route optimization—techs wasting time with inefficient routing (secondary priority)

What we agreed:
- Phase 1: I'll build an AI phone answering + booking system that integrates with ServiceM8
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks to build and test, then 1 week deployment + training
- You'll provide: ServiceM8 API access, sample call scripts, access to test with real calls
- Success = Faster booking conversion, fewer missed calls, measurable time saved

Next steps:
1. I'll send over the beta agreement (formalizes free implementation + testimonial exchange)
2. Once signed, I'll need ServiceM8 admin access (I'll send specific permissions needed)
3. I'll start building next week, check in Friday with initial design for your feedback

Sound good? Any questions or did I miss anything?

Cheers,
Rio
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Shows active listening
- ✅ Confirms mutual understanding
- ✅ Clear deliverables and timeline
- ✅ Specific next actions
- ✅ Invites correction if anything missed

## TESTIMONIAL REQUEST FRAMEWORK

### When to Use
- 2-4 weeks after implementation is live
- After measurable results achieved
- While ROI is fresh in their mind

### Framework: Make It Stupid Easy

**Core Principle:**
The easier you make it, the more likely they do it.

**Levels of Friction (Use Appropriate Level):**

**Level 1: Maximum Ease (For Busy Clients)**
- You draft the testimonial based on results
- They review, edit, approve
- Takes them 2 minutes

**Level 2: Guided Questions (For Articulate Clients)**
- You provide 4 specific questions
- They record 2-min video answering them
- Or they write answers, you format

**Level 3: Open-Ended (For Enthusiastic Clients)**
- "Tell me about your experience working with me"
- They create testimonial however they want

**Start with Level 2, fall back to Level 1 if they don't respond.**

### Adaptive Request Template

**Context Variables:**
- {name}
- {solution_built}
- {time_running}
- {measurable_results}

**Template:**
```
Hey {name},

The {solution_built} has been running for {time_running} now and we're seeing {measurable_results}. Pumped with how it's going.

As we discussed at the start, I'd love to grab a quick video testimonial from you. Makes a huge difference for me as I'm building this out.

Just 2-3 minutes answering these questions:

1. What problem were you trying to solve before we started?
2. What did I build for you?
3. What results have you seen? (time saved, money saved, stress reduced, etc.)
4. Would you recommend me to other operators in your industry?

Two options (whatever's easier for you):
A) Record on your phone and text/email it over
B) Jump on a quick Zoom, I'll record it (5 min max)

Also, as we discussed, I'd love intros to 2-3 other [industry] operators who might benefit from this. Who comes to mind?

Appreciate it mate.

Cheers,
Rio
```

**If No Response After 1 Week → Level 1 (Write It For Them):**
```
Hey {name},

No stress if you've been swamped. I know testimonials are low on the priority list.

I drafted something based on our conversations—does this sound right? Feel free to edit however you want, or I can rewrite if it's off.

---

DRAFT:

"Before working with Rio, we were [problem]. Our team was spending [X hours] on [manual process] and things were falling through the cracks.

Rio built us [solution] that integrated with our existing systems. Implementation took about [X weeks] and honestly, it's saved us [X hours/week] and [$ amount or other metric].

The best part is [specific benefit]. I'd definitely recommend Rio to other [industry] operators who are dealing with [similar problem]."

- {Name}, {Business Name}

Sound good? Just reply "approved" and I'll use it. Or let me know what to change.

Cheers,
Rio
```

## OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORK

(Note: Full framework in separate objection-handling.md file)

**Quick Reference:**

**"Too expensive"**
→ Reframe to ROI: "If this saves you 10 hours/week, what's that worth?"

**"Not sure AI will work for us"**
→ Prove with your own businesses: "I tested this in Ki Landscapes first. Here's what happened..."

**"We're too busy right now"**
→ Flip it: "Being too busy is exactly why you need this. That's the problem we're solving."

**"Let me think about it"**
→ Uncover real objection: "Of course. What specifically are you thinking through?"

---

## REFERRAL REQUEST FRAMEWORK

### When to Use
- After successful implementation
- Client is happy with results
- Part of beta agreement (remind them)

### Framework: Make It Effortless

**Step 1: Ask for Specific Names**
Don't say "know anyone?" Say "who specifically comes to mind?"

**Step 2: Draft the Intro For Them**
They just forward your email. Zero work.

### Adaptive Template

**Request:**
```
Hey {name},

Glad {solution} is working well. Quick favor—I'd love intros to 2-3 other {industry} operators who might benefit from this.

Who specifically comes to mind that's dealing with {similar problem}?

If you share their contact info, I'll draft the intro email and you just forward it (makes it super easy for you).

Cheers,
Rio
```

**Pre-Written Intro Email (You Send to Them to Forward):**
```
Subject: Quick intro - Rio Butler

Hey [Friend's Name],

Quick intro. Rio Butler runs Ki Landscapes here on the Sunshine Coast and recently helped me [specific result using the actual solution].

We went from [before state] to [after state] in about [timeframe]. Saved me [time/money], and honestly made my life way less chaotic.

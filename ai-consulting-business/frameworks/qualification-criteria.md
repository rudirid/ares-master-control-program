# QUALIFICATION CRITERIA SYSTEM
## Accept/Decline Decision Framework for AI Consulting Clients

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: SAYING NO IS STRATEGIC

**Why Qualification Matters:**
- Wrong clients waste time, drain energy, don't pay, and hurt reputation
- Right clients get results, provide testimonials, refer others, and pay on time
- You can't serve everyone - focus on Stage 2-3 home services operators where you add most value

**Framework Philosophy:**
- Qualify BEFORE discovery call (save time)
- Disqualify gracefully (maintain reputation)
- Track decline reasons (pattern recognition)
- Reconnect when they're ready (timing matters)

## CATEGORY 1: BUSINESS STAGE QUALIFICATION

**Reference:** `5-stage-business-model.md`

### ✅ ACCEPT: Stage 2-3 ($250K-$2M Revenue)

**Stage 2 ($250K-$750K) - PRIMARY TARGET:**
- Revenue: $250K-$750K annually
- Team: 5-15 staff
- Owner works: 60-80 hours/week
- Clear operational pain: Things falling through cracks
- Budget: $3K-$7K for single implementation
- **Why Accept:** Perfect fit for your services, immediate ROI, manageable complexity

**Stage 3 ($750K-$2M) - SECONDARY TARGET:**
- Revenue: $750K-$2M annually
- Team: 15-30 staff (multiple crews)
- Owner works: 50-70 hours/week
- Pain: Quality inconsistency, process enforcement, scaling constraints
- Budget: $7K-$15K for implementations
- **Why Accept:** Higher budgets, more complex problems, good for case studies

### ❌ DECLINE: Stage 1 ($0-$250K) and Stage 5 ($10M+)

**Stage 1 - TOO EARLY:**
- Revenue: Under $250K
- Team: Solo or 1-2 helpers
- Pain: "Not enough customers" (lead gen problem, not automation)
- Budget: Can't afford $3K+
- **Why Decline:** Not ready for AI/automation, need basic business systems first

**Graceful Decline Script:**
```
"Really appreciate you reaching out. Based on where you're at ($150K revenue, solo operator), I don't think AI automation is the right move yet.

Your priority should be consistent lead generation and basic systems. Once you're at $250K+ consistently and hiring your first few staff, THEN automation makes sense.

Let's reconnect when you hit $250K. In the meantime, here are 3 resources that'll help more than I can right now: [provide value]"
```

**Stage 5 - TOO BIG:**
- Revenue: $10M+
- Team: 100+ staff, executive team
- Pain: Enterprise-grade problems
- Expectation: Brand-name vendors, not boutique consultants
- **Why Decline:** They need enterprise solutions you can't provide, or want brand names

**Graceful Decline Script:**
```
"This sounds like a great business you've built. Honestly, you're at a scale where you need enterprise-grade solutions and I'm not set up for that.

I'd recommend talking to [enterprise vendor names] or [management consulting firm]. They're better equipped for $10M+ operations.

If you have a specific niche problem that's not worth their time, happy to chat, but I don't want to waste yours if you need full-scale transformation."
```

---

## CATEGORY 2: OPERATIONAL PAIN QUALIFICATION

### ✅ ACCEPT: Specific, Automation-Solvable Pain

**Green Flag Pain Points:**
- "Missed calls = lost revenue" → Lead management automation
- "Spending 15 hours/week on quotes and scheduling" → Admin automation
- "Teams don't know where to go, wasting drive time" → Route optimization
- "Quality inconsistent across crews" → Quality control systems
- "Customers complain about lack of communication" → Auto-updates/confirmations

**Why Accept:** Clear, measurable pain + AI/automation is the right solution + ROI is obvious

### ❌ DECLINE: Vague, Non-Automation Problems

**Red Flag "Pain Points":**
- "I need more customers" → Marketing problem, not automation (unless it's missed leads)
- "I want to scale" → Vague, no specific pain identified
- "Heard AI is the future, want to get ahead" → Shiny object syndrome, no real problem
- "My staff sucks" → People problem, not tech problem
- "Busy season is crazy" → Seasonal constraint, not year-round issue

**Why Decline:** AI won't solve these problems, they need different help

**Graceful Decline Script:**
```
"Based on what you described, it sounds like your main issue is [marketing/hiring/seasonal capacity].

AI automation works best when you have operational chaos - things falling through cracks, manual admin work eating your time, inconsistent quality.

For your situation, I'd suggest [specific alternative: marketing consultant, hiring system, seasonal planning]. That'll have bigger impact.

If you start hitting operational pain as you grow, circle back and I'll help then."
```

### ⚠️ CAUTION: Generic Pain (Dig Deeper)

**Statements that need clarification:**
- "I'm too busy" → Busy doing what? Billable work or admin?
- "I need to systemize" → What specifically breaks without you?
- "Want to work less" → What's taking all your time?

**Discovery Questions to Qualify:**
- "When you say too busy, what's taking up most of YOUR time specifically?"
- "If you could wave a wand and automate one thing, what would have biggest impact?"
- "Walk me through your day yesterday - where did time go?"

**Accept if:** They identify specific tasks (admin, scheduling, follow-ups)
**Decline if:** They stay vague after 2-3 probing questions (don't know what they want)

---

## CATEGORY 3: BUDGET CAPACITY QUALIFICATION

### ✅ ACCEPT: Can Afford Implementation + Sees Value

**Green Flags:**
- Revenue: $250K+ (1-3% of revenue = $2.5K-$7.5K budget realistic)
- Already spends money on tools (ServiceM8, Xero, etc.) → Values systems
- Asks about ROI, not just price → Thinks like investor
- Mentions past investments in business (truck, tools, software) → Willing to invest
- Profitable or breaking even → Has cash flow

**Budget Ranges by Stage:**
- Stage 2 early ($250K-$400K): $3K-$5K comfortable
- Stage 2 solid ($400K-$750K): $5K-$7K comfortable
- Stage 3 ($750K-$2M): $7K-$15K comfortable

**Why Accept:** They can afford it + understand investment vs expense

### ❌ DECLINE: Can't Afford or Price-Shopping

**Red Flags:**
- Revenue under $200K → Likely can't afford $3K+
- First question: "What's your best price?" → Price shopper, not value buyer
- "I can only spend $500" for full implementation → Unrealistic expectations
- Cash flow crisis (mentions can't make payroll) → Survival mode, not investment mode
- Wants spec work / free audit → Value extraction, not serious buyer

**Why Decline:** Wrong budget expectations, or can't afford service

**Graceful Decline Script (Can't Afford):**
```
"I appreciate you reaching out. Based on your revenue ($180K), I don't think the investment makes sense yet.

My implementations start at $3K because they're custom-built and I support them ongoing. That's probably too much for where you're at.

Let's reconnect when you're consistently over $250K/year. You'll have more budget and the automation will have bigger impact."
```

**Graceful Decline Script (Price Shopper):**
```
"Sounds like you're shopping around on price - totally get it.

Just to set expectations: I'm not the cheapest option. I charge more because I use these systems in my own businesses and I support them after implementation.

If price is your main decision factor, I'm probably not the right fit. But if you want someone who's actually done this and will make it work, let's talk."
```

### ⚠️ CAUTION: "I Need to See ROI First"

**This is reasonable, but probe:**
- "What ROI would you need to see to make this worth it?"
- "If I show you the math with your numbers, and it makes sense, is budget available?"

**Accept if:** They have budget but need convincing (normal)
**Decline if:** They want guaranteed ROI with no risk (unrealistic)

---

## CATEGORY 4: SYSTEM READINESS QUALIFICATION

### ✅ ACCEPT: Already Using Some Tools

**Green Flags:**
- Using ServiceM8, Xero, Fergus, or similar job management software
- Has business email (not just Gmail personal)
- Comfortable with tech ("I'm not an expert but I figure things out")
- Website exists (even if basic)
- Takes card payments digitally (Square, Stripe, etc.)

**Why Accept:** Tech-ready, won't fight every implementation, understands value of systems

### ❌ DECLINE: Paper-Based or Tech-Resistant

**Red Flags:**
- "Everything's in my head" / "I just use paper and a calendar"
- "I hate technology" / "I'm not a tech guy"
- "I don't trust digital stuff" / Paranoid about cloud/security
- Still using cash/checks only
- Doesn't have email or website

**Why Decline:** Too much foundational work needed, will resist every step

**Graceful Decline Script:**
```
"Based on what you described (paper-based, no software), I think you need to get some basic systems in place before AI/automation makes sense.

Start with:
1. Job management software (ServiceM8or Fergus - $50-100/month)
2. Accounting software (Xero or QuickBooks)
3. Use those for 3-6 months, get comfortable

Once those are working, THEN we layer automation on top. Trying to skip straight to AI will be too much change at once.

Happy to reconnect once you've got the basics humming."
```

### ⚠️ CAUTION: "I'm Not Tech-Savvy"

**This is common and okay IF:**
- They're willing to learn
- They value systems even if they don't understand them
- They have staff who are tech-capable
- They've successfully adopted tools before (even if it was hard)

**Discovery Questions:**
- "Do you use any software now for jobs or accounting?"
- "How did you find learning that? Hard but worth it, or frustrating?"
- "Do you have anyone on your team who's good with tech?"

**Accept if:** Willing learner, not tech-resistant
**Decline if:** "I'll never understand tech and I don't want to"

---

## CATEGORY 5: DECISION AUTHORITY QUALIFICATION

### ✅ ACCEPT: Can Make Decisions (Sole or Co-Decision-Maker)

**Green Flags:**
- Sole owner/operator → Makes all decisions
- Partnership but says "I handle operations decisions" → Has authority in their domain
- "I need to run it by my wife but she trusts me on business stuff" → Respectful co-decision
- Willing to include partner in discovery call → Collaborative, not hiding

**Why Accept:** Can actually commit, won't get stuck in approval loops

### ❌ DECLINE: No Authority or Phantom Decision-Maker

**Red Flags:**
- "I'll need to talk to my boss" → They're an employee, not owner
- "My business partner makes all financial decisions and he's impossible to reach" → Phantom gatekeeper
- Multiple "I'll need to check with..." stakeholders → Too many cooks
- Changes story about who decides → Deflection tactic

**Why Decline:** Can't close deal, will waste time in approval limbo

**Graceful Decline Script:**
```
"Sounds like [partner/boss] is really the decision-maker here.

I'd rather talk directly to them so I can answer questions and we're not playing telephone.

Can you intro me, or should I just wait until they're ready to explore this?"

[If they can't facilitate intro → Move on]
```

### ⚠️ CAUTION: "Need to Talk to Business Partner/Wife"

**This is often legitimate, but verify:**
- "What's their usual take on investments like this - conservative or growth-minded?"
- "Do you make decisions together, or do you each have areas you own?"
- "Would it help if they joined our next call?"

**Accept if:** Genuine co-decision, willing to include them
**Decline if:** Hiding behind partner, won't facilitate conversation

---

## CATEGORY 6: RELATIONSHIP STRENGTH QUALIFICATION

### ✅ ACCEPT: Warm Intro or Existing Relationship

**Green Flags:**
- Referred by existing client → Pre-validated
- Friend or acquaintance → Trust already exists
- Engaged with your content multiple times → Knows your vibe
- Met at event and followed up → Took initiative
- Past client from another business (Ki Landscapes, Asah Homes) → Proven relationship

**Why Accept:** Relationship shortcuts objections, higher close rate, easier to work with

### ❌ DECLINE: Red Flags in Communication

**Red Flags:**
- Rude or demanding in initial contact → Cultural misfit
- "I need this done yesterday" → Unrealistic expectations
- Doesn't respond to questions → Not serious
- Asks for free work upfront ("Send me a proposal for my exact situation") → Value extraction

**Why Decline:** Life's too short to work with assholes or tire-kickers

**Graceful Decline Script:**
```
"Based on our exchange so far, I don't think we're the right fit for each other.

I work best with [collaborative/respectful/patient] clients, and I'm sensing this might not be a good match.

I'd recommend [alternative referral if you have one]. Best of luck with your business."
```

### ⚠️ CAUTION: Cold Outreach (Rare for You)

**If someone cold-reaches you (DM, email, website contact):**
- **Assess quickly:** Stage, pain, budget (ask 3-4 questions)
- **Look for green flags:** Engaged with content, specific pain, reasonable budget
- **Red flags:** Generic message, "looking for quotes", impatient

**Accept if:** They did their homework, specific pain, qualified financially
**Decline if:** Spray-and-pray mass outreach, no research, price shopping

## WHEN TO SAY NO (SPECIFIC SCENARIOS)

### Scenario 1: Wrong Stage
**Situation:** Solo landscaper, $120K revenue, no staff
**Decision:** DECLINE
**Script:** "You're in growth mode, which is great. But automation doesn't make sense until you're at $250K+ with a few staff members. Focus on lead gen and hiring first. Let's reconnect when you hit $250K."

### Scenario 2: Wrong Problem
**Situation:** $600K revenue, 10 staff, but main pain is "I need more customers"
**Decision:** DECLINE (or pivot)
**Script:** "Sounds like your bottleneck is marketing/lead gen, not operations. AI can help, but you might get more value from [marketing consultant]. If you're also dealing with operational chaos (missed leads, scheduling issues), let's talk about that specifically."

### Scenario 3: Wrong Budget
**Situation:** $400K revenue, wants "cheapest option", shopping 5 providers
**Decision:** DECLINE
**Script:** "Sounds like you're optimizing for price. I'm probably not the cheapest option because I support implementations ongoing and use these systems myself. If you find someone cheaper who delivers, go with them. If quality and support matter more than price, let's talk."

### Scenario 4: Wrong Personality Fit
**Situation:** First message is demanding, rude, or entitled
**Decision:** DECLINE
**Script:** "I don't think we're the right fit. Best of luck finding a solution."

### Scenario 5: Not Ready (But Could Be Later)
**Situation:** $220K revenue, growing fast, will hit $250K in 3 months
**Decision:** NURTURE (follow up later)
**Script:** "You're close but not quite ready yet. Let's stay in touch - when you hit $250K consistently for 2-3 months, ping me and we'll talk. In the meantime, here's [valuable resource]."

## TRACKING DECLINES (PATTERN RECOGNITION)

**Log every decline in:** `client-pipeline/declined-leads.yaml`

**Track:**
- Date
- Business name
- Decline reason (stage, budget, pain, etc.)
- Follow-up date (if applicable)
- Referral given (if any)

**Why Track:**
- Pattern recognition: If declining 80% for "Stage 1", your lead gen is targeting wrong stage
- Future reconnection: "Stage 1" businesses grow into "Stage 2"
- Reputation: Declining gracefully with value = they remember you when ready

**Example Log:**
```yaml
- date: "2025-01-15"
  business: "ABC Plumbing"
  revenue: "$180K"
  decline_reason: "Stage 1 - too early"
  follow_up: "2025-07-01"
  referral: "Recommended basic ServiceM8 setup"
  notes: "Great operator, just not ready yet. Reconnect when hits $250K."
```

---

## GRACEFUL DECLINE TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Too Early (Stage 1)
```
"Thanks for reaching out! Based on where you're at [$X revenue, solo/small team], I don't think AI automation is the right move yet.

Your priorities should be [specific alternatives: lead gen, basic systems, hiring].

Once you're at $250K+ revenue consistently, automation makes way more sense. Let's reconnect then.

In the meantime, here are some resources that'll help:
- [Resource 1]
- [Resource 2]

Cheers,
Rio"
```

### Template 2: Wrong Problem
```
"Appreciate you thinking of me. Based on what you described, it sounds like your main challenge is [marketing/hiring/seasonal], not operational automation.

For that, I'd recommend [specific alternative or referral].

If you start hitting operational pain points (missed leads, admin overload, quality issues), circle back and I can help with that.

Best,
Rio"
```

### Template 3: Budget Misalignment
```
"Thanks for the inquiry. Just to set expectations upfront: my implementations start at $3K because they're custom-built and supported ongoing.

Based on your [revenue/situation], that might not be the right investment yet.

If budget opens up as you grow, reach out. If you need something more affordable, I'd check out [DIY resources or cheaper alternatives].

Cheers,
Rio"
```

### Template 4: Not the Right Fit
```
"Based on our conversation, I don't think I'm the right fit for what you're looking for.

[Optional: Specific reason - 'You need enterprise-grade solutions' or 'My approach is more hands-on than you want']

I'd recommend [referral if applicable, or 'exploring other options'].

Best of luck with your business.

Rio"
```

### Template 5: Nurture (Not Ready Yet, But Soon)
```
"This sounds promising, but I think you're about 3-6 months early based on [specific reason: revenue, team size, systems].

Let's stay in touch. When you [hit $250K / hire your 5th employee / stabilize operations], ping me and we'll dive in.

In the meantime, here's [value: resource, tip, intro] that'll help.

Talk soon,
Rio"
```

**Rio's Natural Qualification Style:**
- ADHD brain = low tolerance for tire-kickers
- Direct questions, cuts through BS quickly
- Respects people who are direct back
- Will walk away from bad fits without guilt
- Values time highly (60-80 hour weeks, every hour counts)

**Adapt Framework to Rio's Approach:**
- Be direct in qualification questions (no beating around bush)
- Time-box decision process ("Let's figure out fit in next 15 minutes")
- Trust gut on personality fit (if they annoy you in first message, decline)
- Don't over-nurture low-probability leads (ADHD = shiny object risk)
- Focus on Stage 2-3 where you're most effective

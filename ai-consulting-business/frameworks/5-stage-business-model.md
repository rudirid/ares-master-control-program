# 5-STAGE BUSINESS MODEL FOR HOME SERVICES
## Diagnostic Framework for Client Assessment

---

## OVERVIEW

This framework helps identify where a home services business is in their growth journey, which determines:
- What problems they're facing RIGHT NOW
- What AI solutions will actually help (vs. waste money)
- How to price your services appropriately
- What success looks like at their stage

**CRITICAL:** Don't propose Stage 4 solutions to Stage 2 businesses. They'll fail.

---

## STAGE 1: SURVIVAL ($0-$250K Revenue)

### Characteristics
**Revenue:** $0-$250K annually
**Team:** Solo operator or 1-2 helpers
**Owner's Role:** Does EVERYTHING (sales, delivery, admin, operations)
**Working Hours:** 60-80+ hours/week
**Cash Flow:** Erratic, feast or famine
**Systems:** None. It's all in the owner's head.

### Primary Pain Points
- "I can't find enough customers"
- "Cash flow is killing me"
- "I'm doing everything myself"
- "I don't know if I'm even making money"
- "I can't afford to hire help"

### What They Actually Need
**NOT AI solutions.** They need:
1. Consistent lead generation
2. Simple sales process
3. Basic bookkeeping
4. Time management

**Why AI Won't Help Yet:**
- They don't have enough volume to justify automation
- Their problem is "not enough work" not "too much work"
- They can't afford implementation costs
- Manual processes work fine at this scale

### Diagnostic Questions
- "How much revenue did you do last year?"
- "How many jobs do you complete per week?"
- "Do you have any employees or just you?"
- "What's your biggest challenge right now?"

### Qualification Decision
**DO NOT TAKE STAGE 1 CLIENTS** unless:
- They're about to break into Stage 2 (hiring first employee, consistent $20K+/month)
- They have a specific high-value problem AI solves (rare)
- They're willing to pay $3K+ for implementation

**Most Stage 1 businesses aren't ready. Politely decline and suggest reconnecting when they hit $250K.**

---

## STAGE 2: STABILITY ($250K-$750K Revenue) ⭐ PRIMARY TARGET

### Characteristics
**Revenue:** $250K-$750K annually
**Team:** 5-15 staff (techs, admin, sometimes sales)
**Owner's Role:** Still does too much, can't delegate effectively
**Working Hours:** 60-80 hours/week
**Cash Flow:** More consistent but still stressful
**Systems:** Some, but mostly in owner's head or scattered across tools

### Primary Pain Points
- "I'm working IN the business, not ON it"
- "I can't take a holiday without everything falling apart"
- "Things are falling through the cracks (leads, follow-ups, scheduling)"
- "Inconsistent quality from my team"
- "I'm drowning in admin work"
- "Taking jobs I don't even want because I need the cash"

### What They Actually Need (THIS IS YOUR SWEET SPOT)
1. **Lead management automation** - Stop missing calls, follow-ups
2. **Scheduling/routing optimization** - Reduce drive time, maximize billable hours
3. **Quality control systems** - Checklists, photo documentation, customer feedback
4. **Admin automation** - Invoicing, quotes, follow-ups
5. **Customer communication** - Auto-updates, confirmations, feedback requests

**Why AI Works Here:**
- Enough volume to justify automation (20-50 jobs/week)
- Clear ROI (time saved = money saved)
- Pain is operational chaos, AI solves this
- Can afford $3K-7K implementations

### Diagnostic Questions
- "How many jobs do you complete per week?"
- "What's taking up most of YOUR time right now?"
- "Where are things falling through the cracks?"
- "Can you take a 2-week holiday without checking in?"
- "What systems are you currently using?" (ServiceM8, Xero, etc.)

### Qualification Decision
**IDEAL CLIENTS.** Proceed if:
- Revenue $250K-$750K
- 5-15 staff
- Owner works 60-80 hours/week
- Clear operational pain point
- Uses some tools already (shows they value systems)
- Can afford $3K-7K

### Typical AI Solutions for Stage 2
- AI phone answering + lead capture
- Automated quote generation
- Route optimization for field techs
- Customer communication automation
- Photo/quality documentation systems

---

## STAGE 3: SUCCESS ($750K-$2M Revenue)

### Characteristics
**Revenue:** $750K-$2M annually
**Team:** 15-30 staff (multiple crews, dedicated admin, maybe sales manager)
**Owner's Role:** Should be strategic, but often still operational
**Working Hours:** 50-70 hours/week
**Cash Flow:** Generally stable, some predictability
**Systems:** Some documented, but inconsistent execution

### Primary Pain Points
- "My team isn't following the processes"
- "Quality is inconsistent across crews"
- "I need better visibility into what's happening"
- "My managers need better tools"
- "We're maxing out capacity but can't scale further"
- "Customer complaints are increasing as we grow"

### What They Actually Need
1. **Process documentation + enforcement** - SOP automation, checklists
2. **Dashboard/reporting** - Real-time visibility into operations
3. **Team communication** - Reduce "telephone game" errors
4. **Customer experience consistency** - Every crew delivers same quality
5. **Capacity optimization** - Maximize output without hiring more

**Why AI Works Here:**
- Multiple crews = coordination complexity
- Quality consistency problems
- Data scattered across systems
- Manager productivity matters

### Diagnostic Questions
- "How many crews/teams do you have?"
- "How do you ensure consistent quality across all teams?"
- "What visibility do you have into daily operations?"
- "Where are you hitting capacity constraints?"
- "What's your biggest bottleneck to getting to $5M?"

### Qualification Decision
**GOOD CLIENTS** if:
- Revenue $750K-$2M
- Multiple teams/crews
- Documented processes exist (even if not followed)
- Clear scaling constraints
- Budget for $7K-15K implementations

### Typical AI Solutions for Stage 3
- Operations dashboard (real-time visibility)
- Quality control automation (photo verification, checklists)
- Team communication automation
- Customer experience standardization
- Predictive scheduling/capacity planning

---

## STAGE 4: SCALE ($2M-$10M Revenue)

### Characteristics
**Revenue:** $2M-$10M annually
**Team:** 30-100+ staff (managers, multiple departments)
**Owner's Role:** Strategic, CEO-level work
**Working Hours:** 40-50 hours/week (if systems work)
**Cash Flow:** Predictable, likely profitable
**Systems:** Documented and mostly enforced

### Primary Pain Points
- "We need better data to make strategic decisions"
- "Integration between systems is manual and error-prone"
- "Hiring and training can't keep up with growth"
- "Customer acquisition cost is too high"
- "We're leaving money on the table somewhere but don't know where"

### What They Actually Need
1. **Advanced analytics** - Profitability by job type, crew, customer
2. **System integration** - Stop manually transferring data between tools
3. **Hiring/training automation** - Scale team faster
4. **Marketing optimization** - Better targeting, lower CAC
5. **Financial modeling** - Predictive forecasting

**Why AI Works Here:**
- Data complexity requires intelligence
- Multiple systems need orchestration
- Strategic decisions need better insights
- ROI on optimization is massive at scale

### Diagnostic Questions
- "What data do you wish you had to make better decisions?"
- "How many systems do you use and how do they talk to each other?"
- "What's your customer acquisition cost and lifetime value?"
- "Where are you most profitable (job type, customer segment, geography)?"
- "What's preventing you from getting to $20M?"

### Qualification Decision
**GREAT CLIENTS** if:
- Revenue $2M-$10M
- Professional management team in place
- Budget for $15K-$30K implementations
- Data-driven decision making culture
- Clear strategic goals

**CAUTION:** May need capabilities beyond your current offerings. Consider partnering with specialized firms or building advanced solutions.

### Typical AI Solutions for Stage 4
- Advanced analytics/BI dashboards
- System integration/orchestration
- Predictive modeling (demand, profitability, churn)
- Customer segmentation/targeting optimization
- Automated financial forecasting

## STAGE 5: MATURITY ($10M+ Revenue)

### Characteristics
**Revenue:** $10M+ annually
**Team:** 100+ staff, executive team, multiple locations
**Owner's Role:** Board-level strategy, potentially planning exit
**Working Hours:** 20-40 hours/week
**Cash Flow:** Highly predictable, sophisticated financial management
**Systems:** Mature, enterprise-grade

### Primary Pain Points
- "We need enterprise-grade solutions"
- "Exit planning / business valuation optimization"
- "Legacy systems holding us back"
- "Innovation has slowed"
- "Market expansion (new geographies, services)"

### What They Actually Need
**Probably NOT you.** They need:
- Enterprise software vendors
- Management consulting firms
- M&A advisors
- Private equity support

### Qualification Decision
**REFER OUT** unless:
- You have enterprise-grade capabilities
- They have a specific niche problem you solve
- They're willing to work with boutique provider (rare)

**Most Stage 5 businesses want brand-name vendors, not solo consultants.**

## HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK

### During Discovery Call

**Step 1: Identify Stage**
Ask diagnostic questions from each stage until you narrow it down.

**Quick Diagnostic:**
- "How much revenue last year?" → Narrows to 2-3 stages
- "How many staff?" → Confirms stage
- "What's your biggest operational pain?" → Validates stage

**Step 2: Validate Problems Match Stage**
If they say Stage 2 revenue but Stage 4 problems → dig deeper.
- Maybe they're misdiagnosing
- Maybe they're transitioning between stages
- Maybe they're lying about revenue (rare but possible)

**Step 3: Check if AI is Right Solution**
Just because they're in Stage 2-4 doesn't mean AI solves their problem.

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Is their problem actually automation-solvable?
- Do they have enough volume to justify implementation cost?
- Are they ready to change processes?
- Do they have budget for this?

**Step 4: Propose Stage-Appropriate Solution**
Don't oversell. Solve the ONE problem that hurts most at their stage.

**Example:**
- Stage 2 client: "You need lead management automation, not advanced analytics"
- Stage 3 client: "You need operations dashboard, not phone answering (you have admin for that)"

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Wrong Stage for Your Services:**
- Stage 1: Not ready, decline politely
- Stage 5: Too big, refer to enterprise vendors

**Stage-Problem Mismatch:**
- Stage 2 business asking for Stage 4 solutions → They're trying to skip steps, will fail
- Stage 4 business asking for Stage 2 solutions → They're not being honest about actual problems

**Budget Misalignment:**
- Stage 2 client expecting free/cheap solutions → Not serious, will be nightmare client
- Stage 4 client balking at $15K price → Something's wrong, investigate

**System Readiness:**
- "We don't use any software, everything's on paper" → Not ready for AI, need basic digitization first
- "We have 15 different systems that don't talk to each other" → Integration hell, be cautious

### After Stage Identification

**Update Client Record:**
```yaml
client: "ABC Plumbing"
stage: 2
stage_indicators:
  - revenue: "$450K annually"
  - team_size: "8 staff"
  - owner_hours: "70 hours/week"
  - systems: "ServiceM8, Xero, paper for some things"

stage_appropriate_solutions:
  - priority_1: "Lead management automation"
  - priority_2: "Route optimization"
  - priority_3: "Quote automation"

next_action: "Propose lead management as Phase 1"
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

**Mistake 1: Assuming Stage from Revenue Alone**
A $500K business with 3 staff is very different from $500K with 25 staff.
→ Always ask about team size, owner involvement, systems.

**Mistake 2: Proposing Advanced Solutions to Early-Stage Businesses**
Stage 2 client doesn't need predictive analytics dashboard.
→ Solve their actual pain, not your cool solution.

**Mistake 3: Taking Every Client That Calls**
Stage 1 and Stage 5 are bad fits. Politely decline.
→ Focus on Stage 2-3 where you add most value.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Cultural Readiness**
Business might be Stage 3 by metrics but owner thinks like Stage 1.
→ Ask: "How do you feel about changing processes?"

**Mistake 5: Skipping Stage Validation**
Client says they're Stage 3, but answers reveal Stage 2.
→ Trust your diagnostic questions, not their self-assessment.

**MISSION:** Fix this issue: $ARGUMENTS

## FIX PROTOCOL

### 1. Rapid Diagnosis (30 seconds)
- Read error message carefully
- Identify root cause (not just symptom)
- Check recent changes that might have caused it

### 2. Solution Strategy
**Pick ONE approach:**
- **Quick Fix**: Known issue with standard solution (use immediately)
- **Investigation**: Need more context (read 1-2 files max)
- **Revert**: Recent change broke things (undo it)

### 3. Execute Fix
- Apply solution
- Test immediately
- Verify error is gone

### 4. Validate Fix
**Required evidence:**
- Error no longer appears ✓
- Feature still works ✓
- No new errors introduced ✓

---

## COMMON FIXES (Use These First)

### Dependency Issues
```bash
npm install          # Missing packages
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install  # Corrupted deps
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :PORT
taskkill //F //PID <pid>

# Linux/Mac
lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill -9
```

### Python Import Errors
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install <package>
```

### Git Conflicts
```bash
git status          # See conflicts
# Edit files, remove <<<< ==== >>>> markers
git add .
git commit
```

### File Not Found
```bash
ls -la              # Check if file exists
pwd                 # Check current directory
```

## FIX MINDSET

**Speed over perfection:**
- Fix the immediate problem first
- Improve/refactor later (if needed)
- Document why it broke (prevent recurrence)

**No over-engineering:**
- Simplest fix that works wins
- Don't add unnecessary complexity
- Validate fix works before explaining

**Evidence required:**
- Run the thing that was broken
- Show it now works
- Provide before/after proof

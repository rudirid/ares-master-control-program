    primary_topic: "Customer acquisition strategy for AI consulting business"
    context: "Building AI implementation consulting for home services operators ($250K-$1M revenue, 60-80hr weeks, operational chaos). Beta program targeting 3-5 clients by Dec 31, official launch Jan 2025. First potential client: Daren (pest control/air con, $5-10M)."

    # What communication strategies were EFFECTIVE
    effective_strategies:
      - strategy: "Calling out unfounded technical claims"
        example: "Admitted making claims about ServiceM8 routing without verification, violated ARES core directive"
        rio_response: "Appreciated transparency and honesty about mistake"
        effectiveness_score: 95
        keep_using: true
        notes: "Rio values truth over convenience - this is CORE to trust"

      - strategy: "Discovery-first framework"
        example: "Proposed asking questions in Daren call before proposing solutions"
        rio_response: "Immediately resonated - 'Good call. Let's touch up the website and focus on getting clients'"
        effectiveness_score: 90
        keep_using: true
        notes: "Aligned with Rio's intuition, prevented premature solution-building"

      - strategy: "Confidence scoring on recommendations"
        example: "HIGH (85%), MEDIUM (65%), LOW (40%) with reasoning"
        rio_response: "No negative feedback, engaged with the transparency"
        effectiveness_score: 85
        keep_using: true
        notes: "Helps Rio know when to trust recommendations vs validate independently"

      - strategy: "Straight talk about mistakes"
        example: "When Rio said 'You said same thing 3 times,' responded: 'You're absolutely right. Here's what happened...' then explained the cause"
        rio_response: "Engaged constructively, asked follow-up about how to fix it"
        effectiveness_score: 90
        keep_using: true
        notes: "No defensiveness, direct acknowledgment of problem"

      - strategy: "Anti-hype positioning language"
        example: "'Not another ChatGPT bro' messaging, calling out cookie-cutter consultants"
        rio_response: "This was Rio's own language from earlier conversation - resonated authentically"
        effectiveness_score: 95
        keep_using: true
        notes: "Using Rio's authentic voice back to him = powerful positioning"

      - strategy: "Systems/framework thinking"
        example: "5-stage business model, value ladder (tripwire→core→ascension), phased rollout"
        rio_response: "Engaged immediately, asked clarifying questions, built on the frameworks"
        effectiveness_score: 95
        keep_using: true
        notes: "This is Rio's native language - speak in systems and he gets it instantly"

      - strategy: "Shiny object callout (website distraction)"
        example: "'Building custom website RIGHT NOW is a distraction from getting clients'"
        rio_response: "'Good call. Let's touch up the website and focus on getting clients.'"
        effectiveness_score: 95
        keep_using: true
        notes: "Direct callout worked - Rio refocused immediately without resistance"

      - strategy: "One question at a time (iterative dialogue)"
        example: "Asked questions sequentially instead of dumping 10 questions at once"
        rio_response: "Rio explicitly requested: 'Can you ask me one question at a time so I can respond more efficiently?'"
        effectiveness_score: 90
        keep_using: true
        notes: "ADHD-friendly, prevents overwhelm, enables focused responses"

      - strategy: "Real business examples from Rio's context"
        example: "Used Ki Landscapes and Daren (pest control) as concrete examples"
        rio_response: "Engaged deeply, provided detailed context about his situations"
        effectiveness_score: 85
        keep_using: true
        notes: "Concrete > abstract for Rio, grounds concepts in his reality"

      - strategy: "Extracting Rio's natural voice"
        example: "Transcribed his voice memo, used his phrases ('mate,' 'pumped,' 'far out') in drafts"
        rio_response: "Approved drafts with minimal edits"
        effectiveness_score: 85
        keep_using: true
        notes: "Rio knows his own voice - mirror it back authentically"

    # What communication strategies FAILED or were INEFFECTIVE
    ineffective_strategies:
      - strategy: "Triple repetition (saying same thing 3 times)"
        example: "Internal Validation Loop → Revised Strategy → Summary all covered same advice"
        rio_response: "'You said the same thing 3 times - what's going on?'"
        effectiveness_score: 10
        stop_using: true
        why_failed: "Rio spotted redundancy immediately, found it confusing/annoying"
        correction: "Show reasoning once clearly, then move on. No summaries of summaries."

      - strategy: "2000-word research document (information overload)"
        example: "Comprehensive research on AI phone systems, route optimization, cost analysis - all at once"
        rio_response: "Implicit - later realized this was too much upfront"
        effectiveness_score: 30
        stop_using: true
        why_failed: "ADHD overwhelm, too much information before it was needed"
        correction: "Phased delivery - give overview, then drill into details on-demand"

      - strategy: "Speculative ROI numbers without data"
        example: "Claimed $45K-90K savings for Daren without knowing his actual costs"
        rio_response: "No pushback, but Ares later identified this as unfounded claim"
        effectiveness_score: 40
        stop_using: true
        why_failed: "Violates truth protocol, could backfire if numbers don't match reality"
        correction: "Say 'Let's find out together' instead of guessing. Only cite verified data."

      - strategy: "Premature solution design (before discovery)"
        example: "Built 4-week implementation roadmap for Daren before having discovery call"
        rio_response: "Accepted initially, but Ares later realized this was jumping ahead"
        effectiveness_score: 50
        stop_using: true
        why_failed: "Risk of building wrong thing, classic consultant mistake"
        correction: "Discovery questions first, solutions after you have real data"

      - strategy: "Unfounded technical claims"
        example: "'ServiceM8 has built-in routing' stated as fact without checking docs"
        rio_response: "No pushback from Rio, but violated ARES core directive"
        effectiveness_score: 20
        stop_using: true
        why_failed: "Critical violation of truth protocol, wastes time if wrong"
        correction: "ALWAYS verify technical claims before stating as fact. Say 'I need to check...' if uncertain."

      - strategy: "Teaching framework for obvious concepts"
        example: "Started to use full Analogy→Concept→Example→Pattern→Action for simple decisions"
        rio_response: "Rio explicitly called out: 'Do I need to introduce the idea? Should I update pics on my platforms?'"
        effectiveness_score: 40
        stop_using: true
        why_failed: "Over-teaching when Rio already understands, insulting his intelligence"
        correction: "Use teaching framework ONLY for genuinely new/complex concepts"

      - strategy: "Generic templates without customization"
        example: "First email draft to Daren was too formal/salesy for a mate"
        rio_response: "Rio revised it to be more casual and natural"
        effectiveness_score: 50
        adjust: true
        why_failed: "Sounded like copy-paste template, not authentic to Rio's relationship with Daren"
        correction: "Always customize for relationship context (mate vs professional contact)"

**MISSION:** Debug and resolve: $ARGUMENTS

## AUTONOMOUS DEBUG PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Analyze Error (Think Hard Mode)
**Gather intelligence:**
- Read full error message and stack trace
- Identify error type (syntax, runtime, logic, dependency, configuration)
- Determine blast radius (single file, module, system-wide)
- Rate complexity: SIMPLE / MEDIUM / COMPLEX

**Think Hard Analysis:**
```
What broke? <precise component>
Why did it break? <root cause hypothesis>
When did it break? <before/after what change>
Impact scope? <isolated / cascading>
```

### Step 2: Check Historical Context
**Read decision-causality.md:**
- Have we solved this before?
- What was the root cause last time?
- What fix worked / didn't work?

**Read tech-success-matrix.md:**
- Is this a known failure pattern?
- Success rate of related technology?
- Any documented workarounds?

**Output:**
```
[CONTEXT CHECK]
Similar issue: <yes/no, reference if found>
Known pattern: <from tech-success-matrix.md>
Previous solution: <from decision-causality.md or "none found">
```

### Step 3: Attempt Fix (Circuit Breaker: Max 3 Retries)

**Attempt 1: Most Likely Fix**
- Apply highest-confidence solution
- Based on error type + historical context
- Test immediately

**Attempt 2: Alternative Approach** (if Attempt 1 fails)
- Try different angle
- Check proven-patterns.md for alternative patterns
- Test immediately

**Attempt 3: Fallback Solution** (if Attempt 2 fails)
- Simplest possible fix (even if not elegant)
- Consider revert to last known good state
- Test immediately

**CIRCUIT BREAKER STOP:**
If all 3 attempts fail → ESCALATE with analysis

### Step 4: Validate with Tests

**Validation checklist:**
- [ ] Original error is gone
- [ ] Feature/functionality works as expected
- [ ] No new errors introduced
- [ ] Tests pass (if test suite exists)
- [ ] Build succeeds (if applicable)

**Run validation:**
```bash
# For Node.js projects
npm test || node test-*.js

# For Python projects
pytest || python -m unittest || python test_*.py

# For builds
npm run build || python setup.py build

# Manual validation
<run the thing that was broken>
```

### Step 5: Report Results Honestly

**SUCCESS FORMAT:**
```
[RESOLVED] <issue name>

Diagnosis:
- Root cause: <what actually broke>
- Error type: <syntax/runtime/logic/dependency/config>
- Impact: <scope of breakage>

Resolution:
- Attempt: <1, 2, or 3>
- Fix applied: <what was changed>
- Files modified: <list with line numbers>

Validation:
✓ Original error eliminated
✓ Functionality restored
✓ Tests: X/X passing
✓ Build: SUCCESS (0 errors, 0 warnings)

Context Update:
- Should update decision-causality.md? <yes/no + reason>
- Should update tech-success-matrix.md? <yes/no + reason>
```

**FAILURE FORMAT:**
```
[ESCALATING] <issue name>

Attempted Solutions:
1. <attempt 1 description> → FAILED: <why>
2. <attempt 2 description> → FAILED: <why>
3. <attempt 3 description> → FAILED: <why>

Circuit breaker triggered after 3 attempts.

Root Cause Analysis:
- Known: <what we know for certain>
- Unknown: <what we don't understand>
- Hypothesis: <best guess at cause>

Recommendations:
1. <option 1 with reasoning>
2. <option 2 with reasoning>
3. <option 3 with reasoning>

Next Steps Required:
- <what needs human decision or external help>
```

## ERROR TYPE PLAYBOOKS

### Syntax Errors (SIMPLE)
**Quick fixes:**
- Check for typos, missing brackets/parentheses
- Verify indentation (Python)
- Look for trailing commas
- **Attempt 1**: Fix obvious syntax issue
- **Attempt 2**: Check file encoding (UTF-8)
- **Attempt 3**: Revert to last commit

### Runtime Errors (MEDIUM)
**Investigation needed:**
- Null/undefined reference
- Type mismatch
- Missing import/module
- **Attempt 1**: Add null checks or type validation
- **Attempt 2**: Install missing dependency
- **Attempt 3**: Use fallback/default values

### Logic Errors (COMPLEX)
**Deep analysis required:**
- Wrong algorithm
- Off-by-one errors
- Race conditions
- **Attempt 1**: Add logging to trace execution
- **Attempt 2**: Check boundary conditions
- **Attempt 3**: Simplify logic to minimal working version

### Dependency Errors (MEDIUM)
**Version conflicts:**
- Package not found
- Version incompatibility
- Breaking changes
- **Attempt 1**: Install/reinstall dependency
- **Attempt 2**: Check version compatibility
- **Attempt 3**: Downgrade to last working version

### Configuration Errors (SIMPLE to MEDIUM)
**Environment issues:**
- Wrong path
- Missing env variable
- Port conflict
- **Attempt 1**: Check .env file or environment
- **Attempt 2**: Verify file paths are absolute
- **Attempt 3**: Reset to default configuration

## AUTONOMOUS DECISION RULES

**When to proceed autonomously (≥80% confidence):**
- Known error pattern with proven fix
- Syntax error with obvious solution
- Standard dependency issue
- Configuration mismatch with clear fix

**When to add caveats (50-79% confidence):**
- Multiple possible causes
- Fix might have side effects
- Limited historical data
- Proceed but note uncertainty

**When to escalate (<50% confidence):**
- Unknown error pattern
- All 3 fix attempts failed
- Critical system with high risk
- Requires architectural decision

---

## SAFETY CHECKS (DO NO HARM)

**Before ANY fix attempt:**
- [ ] Will this cause data loss? → If yes, back up first
- [ ] Will this affect production? → If yes, escalate
- [ ] Will this change dependencies for others? → If yes, document
- [ ] Can this be reverted easily? → If no, create backup

**Auto-revert conditions:**
- Tests fail after fix
- New errors introduced
- Functionality regression
- Build breaks

---

## TRUTH PROTOCOL

**Never say:**
- "This should work" (without testing)
- "The error is probably..." (without evidence)
- "I think this fixes it" (test first)

**Always say:**
- "Error resolved. Tests: X/X passing ✓"
- "Fix applied. Validated with: <evidence>"
- "Unable to resolve after 3 attempts. Analysis: ..."

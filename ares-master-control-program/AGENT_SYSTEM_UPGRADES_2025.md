---

## What Changed and Why

### 1. Long-Horizon Memory System

**File**: `core/agent_memory.py` (NEW)

**Problem Solved**: 2025 Best Practice Gap
- **Old**: Agents were stateless, limited to single-context-window tasks
- **New**: Agents have persistent memory across multiple phases
- **Research**: "Production agents engage in conversations spanning hundreds of turns" (Anthropic 2025)

**Capabilities**:
- **Scratchpad**: Working memory for current phase
- **Completed Phases**: Summaries of finished work
- **Key Decisions**: Record important choices with reasoning
- **Context Summaries**: Compressed context for long tasks
- **Tool Results**: Track tool execution history
- **Validation Results**: ARES protocol outcomes

**Usage Example**:
```python
from core.agent_memory import AgentMemory

# Create memory for long-running task
memory = AgentMemory(
    agent_id="frontend-architect",
    task_id="build-dashboard-v2"
)

# Phase 1: Component design
memory.start_new_phase("component-design")
memory.add_scratchpad("Designing hierarchy: App > Dashboard > Charts...")
memory.record_decision(
    decision="Use Recharts library",
    reasoning="Tier 1 pattern, proven in 5+ projects",
    confidence=0.9
)
memory.complete_phase(
    phase_name="Component Design",
    summary="Designed 12 components with clear hierarchy",
    confidence=0.95
)

# Phase 2: State management (memory persists)
memory.start_new_phase("state-management")
memory.add_scratchpad("Implementing Zustand store...")

# Get context including all past work
context = memory.get_active_context()
# Returns: completed phases + current scratchpad + decisions
```

**Benefits**:
- Agents don't "forget" previous phases
- Can resume multi-day tasks
- Decision history preserved
- Confidence tracking across task

---

### 2. Context Engineering Module

**File**: `core/context_engineer.py` (NEW)

**Problem Solved**: #1 Job of Agent Builders (2025)
- **Old**: No context management, hit limits on large tasks
- **New**: Intelligent context compression, selection, isolation
- **Research**: "Context engineering has been introduced to describe the challenge of effectively communicating to models" (2025 Research)

**Four Key Capabilities**:

#### A. Writing Context Outside the Window
```python
from core.context_engineer import ContextEngineer

engineer = ContextEngineer(max_context_length=100000)

# Add various context types
engineer.add_context(
    chunk_type="code",
    content=file_content,
    relevance=0.9,
    timestamp="2025-10-24"
)

engineer.add_context(
    chunk_type="docs",
    content=documentation,
    relevance=0.6
)
```

#### B. Selecting Relevant Context
```python
# Get most relevant context for query
relevant = engineer.select_relevant_context(
    query="How do I implement authentication?",
    top_k=5
)
# Returns: Top 5 most relevant chunks
```

#### C. Compressing Context
```python
# Compress when approaching limits
engineer.compress_context(
    strategy=CompressionStrategy.HIERARCHICAL,
    target_ratio=0.5  # Compress to 50%
)

# Strategies: SUMMARIZE, TRIM_OLDEST, TRIM_LEAST_RELEVANT, HIERARCHICAL
```

#### D. Isolating Context (Sandboxing)
```python
# Create isolated context for specific agent
isolated = engineer.isolate_agent_context(
    agent_id="backend-architect",
    shared_context="Project requirements..."
)
# Agent gets private context + read-only shared context
```

**Benefits**:
- No more context limit errors
- Most relevant information always included
- Agents can't interfere with each other's context
- Automatic compression when needed

---

### 3. Enhanced Tool Documentation

**File**: `agents_enhanced_registry.json` (NEW)

**Problem Solved**: "Think of LLM as developer on your team - document tools well"
- **Old**: Basic agent descriptions only
- **New**: Detailed tool documentation with examples, schemas, constraints
- **Research**: "Put as much effort into tool configuration as you do into prompts" (2025 Best Practice)

**What's Enhanced**:

#### Before (Old Registry):
```json
{
  "frontend-architect": {
    "description": "Frontend development: React, Vue, Angular, Next.js",
    "domains": ["frontend"],
    "priority": 1
  }
}
```

#### After (Enhanced Registry):
```json
{
  "frontend-architect": {
    "description": "Frontend development specialist: React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, component architecture, state management",
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "React Component Design",
        "description": "Design and implement React components with hooks, props, and state management",
        "input_schema": {
          "component_type": "functional|class",
          "complexity": "simple|moderate|complex",
          "state_management": "useState|useReducer|Redux|Zustand|none",
          "styling": "CSS|Tailwind|styled-components|CSS-in-JS"
        },
        "output_schema": {
          "component_code": "string (TypeScript/JavaScript)",
          "props_interface": "TypeScript interface",
          "tests": "Jest/React Testing Library tests",
          "documentation": "Component usage docs"
        },
        "constraints": [
          "Must use TypeScript for new projects",
          "Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) required",
          "Mobile-first responsive design",
          "Follow React best practices (hooks, composition)"
        ],
        "examples": [
          {
            "task": "Create login form component with validation",
            "good_output": "[Full working code example]"
          }
        ],
        "best_practices": [
          "Use local state (useState) for UI state",
          "Use Context API for theme, auth",
          "Use Redux/Zustand for complex global state"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "success_metrics": {
      "component_reusability": "≥80% components reusable",
      "accessibility_score": "≥90% Lighthouse accessibility",
      "test_coverage": "≥80% for critical user flows"
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Agents understand tools better (like a dev reading API docs)
- Examples show "good output" patterns
- Constraints prevent common mistakes
- Success metrics define quality standards

---

### 4. Knowledge Base RAG Integration

**File**: `core/knowledge_base_rag.py` (NEW)
**Enhanced**: `core/prompt_generator.py`

**Problem Solved**: Context Engineering - Selecting Relevant Context
- **Old**: Patterns manually provided as hints
- **New**: Automatic retrieval of relevant patterns from knowledge base
- **Research**: "RAG for selecting relevant context" (2025 Multi-Agent Systems)

**How It Works**:

#### A. Knowledge Sources
```python
from core.knowledge_base_rag import KnowledgeBaseRAG

rag = KnowledgeBaseRAG(base_path="/path/to/ares-master-control-program")
rag.load_knowledge_base()

# Loads from:
# - proven-patterns.md (Tier 1/2/3 patterns)
# - tech-success-matrix.md (Python 95%, SQLite 100%, etc.)
# - decision-causality.md (Past decisions and reasoning)
```

#### B. Automatic Pattern Retrieval
```python
# Retrieve patterns for frontend task
patterns = rag.retrieve_patterns(
    domain="frontend",
    query="Create React dashboard with charts",
    top_k=3,
    tier_filter=["tier_1", "tier_2"]  # Only proven patterns
)

# Returns relevant chunks with relevance scores:
# 1. "Modular Component Architecture" (Tier 1, 92% relevance)
# 2. "State Management Pattern" (Tier 1, 85% relevance)
# 3. "Component Testing Strategy" (Tier 2, 78% relevance)
```

#### C. Integrated into Prompts
When an agent is invoked, the prompt generator automatically:
1. Analyzes the task domain
2. Retrieves relevant patterns from knowledge base
3. Injects patterns into agent prompt
4. Agent sees proven patterns without manual specification

**Example**:
```python
# User task: "Build login component"
# Agent automatically receives:
# - Pattern: Modular Component Architecture (Tier 1)
# - Tech: React + TypeScript (95% success rate)
# - Decision: Why we use useState vs Redux for forms
# - Anti-Pattern: Don't store passwords in state
```

**Benefits**:
- Agents always use proven patterns
- No manual pattern lookup needed
- Consistent quality across tasks
- Anti-patterns prevented automatically

## How to Use New Capabilities

### Example 1: Long-Running Multi-Phase Task

```python
from core.agent_memory import create_memory
from core.context_engineer import create_context_engineer
from core.orchestrator import create_orchestrator

# Create orchestrator with new capabilities
orchestrator = create_orchestrator(
    knowledge_base_path="/path/to/ares",
    enable_rag=True  # Auto pattern retrieval
)

# Create memory for long task
memory = create_memory(
    agent_id="fullstack-architect",
    task_id="build-saas-platform"
)

# Phase 1: Architecture design
memory.start_new_phase("architecture-design")
plan = orchestrator.plan("Design multi-tenant SaaS architecture")

# Execute phase 1
# [Agent automatically gets relevant patterns via RAG]

memory.record_decision(
    decision="Use PostgreSQL with row-level security",
    reasoning="Multi-tenant best practice, proven in tech-success-matrix.md",
    confidence=0.95
)
memory.complete_phase(
    phase_name="Architecture Design",
    summary="Designed 3-tier architecture: React SPA, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database",
    confidence=0.9
)

# Phase 2: Backend implementation
memory.start_new_phase("backend-implementation")
# Memory from Phase 1 is preserved and available

# Get context including all previous work
context = memory.get_active_context()
```

### Example 2: Context Engineering for Large Codebase

```python
from core.context_engineer import ContextEngineer

# Initialize for large project
engineer = ContextEngineer(max_context_length=100000)

# Add all relevant code files
for file in codebase_files:
    engineer.add_context(
        chunk_type="code",
        content=file.read(),
        relevance=calculate_relevance(file, task),
        metadata={"path": file.path}
    )

# Get optimized context (automatically compressed if needed)
optimized = engineer.get_optimized_context(
    target_length=50000,
    min_relevance=0.5,
    chunk_types=["code", "docs"]
)

# optimized now contains:
# - Only most relevant files
# - Compressed to fit 50K limit
# - Hierarchical structure preserved
```

### Example 3: RAG-Enhanced Agent Prompts

```python
from core.prompt_generator import PromptGenerator

# Initialize with RAG enabled (default)
prompt_gen = PromptGenerator(
    knowledge_base_path="/path/to/ares",
    enable_rag=True
)

# Generate prompt for task
task_analysis = analyze("Build REST API for user management")

prompt = prompt_gen.generate_prompt(
    agent_type="backend-architect",
    task_analysis=task_analysis
)

# Prompt automatically includes:
# - Relevant backend patterns from proven-patterns.md
# - Tech recommendations (FastAPI 85% success, PostgreSQL 100%)
# - Past decision: "Why we use Pydantic for validation"
# - Anti-pattern: "Avoid storing passwords in plain text"
```

- **Knowledge Base**: Existing files, no additional storage
- **Enhanced Registry**: 200KB (vs 20KB for old registry)

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

**No changes required!** All enhancements are backwards compatible.

Old code continues to work:
```python
# This still works exactly as before
orchestrator = create_orchestrator()
plan = orchestrator.plan("Build feature X")
```

### To Use New Capabilities

Add optional parameters:
```python
# Enable RAG and memory
orchestrator = create_orchestrator(
    knowledge_base_path="/path/to/ares",
    enable_rag=True  # Default: True
)
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use Agent Memory

✅ **USE for**:
- Multi-phase tasks (design → implement → test)
- Long-running tasks (> 1 hour)
- Tasks requiring decision history
- Tasks that might be resumed later

❌ **DON'T USE for**:
- Simple single-phase tasks
- Quick code changes
- Read-only analysis

### When to Use Context Engineering

✅ **USE for**:
- Large codebases (> 50 files)
- Tasks approaching context limits
- Multi-agent coordination (isolation needed)
- Performance-sensitive tasks (compression)

❌ **DON'T USE for**:
- Small projects (< 10 files)
- Tasks with minimal context
- Simple queries

### When to Use RAG

✅ **USE for**:
- Tasks in domains with proven patterns (frontend, backend, database)
- Standardized implementations (REST APIs, component design)
- Decisions requiring past context

❌ **DON'T USE for**:
- Completely novel problems (no relevant patterns exist)
- Highly specialized domains (not in knowledge base)

---

## Troubleshooting

### RAG Not Working

**Symptom**: Prompts don't include patterns

**Fixes**:
1. Check knowledge base path is correct
2. Verify knowledge base files exist (proven-patterns.md, etc.)
3. Check RAG is enabled: `enable_rag=True`
4. Look for warning messages during initialization

### Memory Not Persisting

**Symptom**: Memory lost between sessions

**Cause**: No persistence path provided

**Fix**:
```python
memory = AgentMemory(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    task_id="my-task",
    persistence_path=Path("/path/to/save/memory.json")
)
```

### Context Compression Too Aggressive

**Symptom**: Important information lost

**Fixes**:
1. Increase relevance scores for critical content
2. Use hierarchical compression (preserves structure)
3. Increase max_context_length threshold
4. Adjust compression_threshold (default: 0.8)

## FILE UPLOAD ORDER (Recommended)

### **Phase 1: Critical Context** (Upload First)
1. `ARES_V25_STATUS_REPORT.md` ← **START HERE**
2. `ares-core-directives.md`
3. `config/ares.yaml`

**Why**: These 3 files give complete current state + critical analysis

### **Phase 2: Knowledge Context** (Upload Next)
4. `proven-patterns.md`
5. `tech-success-matrix.md`
6. `decision-causality.md`

**Why**: Shows what Ares has learned from your projects

### **Phase 3: Operational Context** (Upload Last)
7. `CLAUDE.md`
8. `ARES_DYNAMIC_VERSIONING.md`
9. `README.md`

**Why**: How the system is invoked and operates

---

## QUICK START (Minimum Context)

**If limited upload capacity, use these 3 files ONLY**:

1. **ARES_V25_STATUS_REPORT.md** (this is comprehensive)
2. **ares-core-directives.md** (shows protocols)
3. **config/ares.yaml** (shows current configuration)

**Total Size**: ~43 KB

These 3 files provide:
- ✅ Current state and gaps
- ✅ Core protocols and identity
- ✅ Configuration and capabilities
- ✅ Weaknesses and recommendations

## CLAUDE CHAT PROMPT (Copy-Paste This)

```
I'm uploading context files about ARES Master Control Program v2.5.0.

Please read these files and:
1. Understand the current state (what's built, what's missing)
2. Analyze the critical weaknesses identified
3. Review the recommendations for improvements
4. Be ready to help implement Phase 1 features

Key questions I'll want to explore:
- How to build the MCP server integration?
- How to implement the delegation layer?
- How to create the subagent registry?
- How to migrate WhatsApp integration to v2.5?

Context files attached:
- ARES_V25_STATUS_REPORT.md (primary - read this first)
- ares-core-directives.md
- config/ares.yaml
- [... list other files you uploaded ...]

Are you ready to help improve Ares v2.5?
```

---

## ALTERNATIVE: Summary-Only Upload

If you prefer a condensed version, upload just:
- **ARES_V25_STATUS_REPORT.md**

This file contains:
- Complete analysis of current state
- All weaknesses identified
- All recommendations
- Architecture diagrams
- Gap analysis
- Priority roadmap

**Standalone completeness**: 95%

---

## FILES NOT NEEDED (Skip These)

### Outdated/Redundant:
- `SNAPSHOT_v2.3_COMPLETE.md` - Milestone doc, not current
- `ARES_INVOCATION_GUIDE.md` - Superseded by CLAUDE.md
- `project-evolution.md` - Timeline only, not critical
- WhatsApp bridge files - Using v2.1, not current

### Too Technical:
- Full core/*.py files - Headers sufficient
- Test files - Not needed for planning
- Log files - Runtime data, not design

---

## EXPECTED CLAUDE UNDERSTANDING

After uploading recommended files, Claude should understand:

**✅ What Ares Is**:
- Personal assistant with validation protocols
- Phase 0 complete (foundation ready)
- Working internal validation, pattern matching
- Dynamic version detection

**✅ What Ares Isn't**:
- NOT a meta-agent orchestrator (yet)
- NO delegation capabilities (designed but not built)
- NO MCP integration (analyzed but not implemented)
- NO subagent registry (planned but missing)

**✅ Critical Weaknesses**:
1. No meta-agent orchestration
2. MCP integration blocking
3. Static pattern library
4. No subagent registry
5. WhatsApp v2.1 fragmentation
6. Reactive validation only
7. Single-user learning
8. Incomplete testing

**✅ Next Steps**:
- Build MCP server (13-19 hours estimated)
- Implement delegation layer
- Create subagent registry
- Migrate WhatsApp to v2.5

**✅ Architecture Gaps**:
- Designed vs. Reality comparison
- 80% foundation, 20% orchestration missing
- Clear roadmap to Phase 1

## POST-UPLOAD VALIDATION

**Ask Claude to confirm it understands**:
1. "What version of Ares am I currently at?"
   - **Expected**: "v2.5.0 - Phase 0 complete"

2. "What are the top 3 weaknesses?"
   - **Expected**: "No meta-agent orchestration, no MCP integration, static pattern library"

3. "What should I build next?"
   - **Expected**: "MCP server integration, then delegation layer, then subagent registry"

4. "Can Ares orchestrate subagents right now?"
   - **Expected**: "No - designed but not implemented (delegation: false)"

## Philosophy

Understanding human decision-making to create authentic connection and mutual benefit. Not manipulation - strategic empathy and behavioral science applied ethically.

**Key Principle:** These tactics should be INVISIBLE. The client should feel heard, understood, and guided - never "sold to" or manipulated.

- Discovery calls (AI consulting business)
- Sales conversations
- Client relationship management
- Proposal presentations
- Objection handling
- Follow-up sequences

### ❌ Never Apply To:
- Internal team communication
- Technical documentation
- Non-sales consulting work
- Personal tasks
- Code reviews

## Pattern Library

### 1. RAPPORT BUILDING (CIA Field Agent Tactics)

**Principle:** Trust before task. CIA field agents build rapport to gather intelligence - we build it to understand true client needs.

**Techniques:**
- **Active listening signals:** Minimal encouragers that show engagement without interrupting
- **Tempo matching:** Mirror their pace and energy level naturally (not their words - that's obvious)
- **Authentic common ground:** Find shared challenges in their industry/stage, not fake interests
- **Calculated vulnerability:** Share a minor challenge to trigger reciprocity

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "I'm building rapport by mirroring your communication style"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "That timeline pressure - we're seeing that across the board in HVAC. How's your team handling the spring rush?"

❌ **OVERT:** "Let me tell you about all our amazing features"
✅ **SUBTLE:** [After they describe problem] "Yeah, we actually struggled with that same issue when we were scaling our outreach. What's your current workaround?"

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- First 5 minutes: Pure listening, minimal talking
- Match their energy (stressed = acknowledge stress; excited = match excitement)
- Find genuine connection point (their industry challenge, not weather)

---

### 2. ELICITATION (CIA Intelligence Gathering)

**Principle:** Understand true needs without interrogation. CIA field officers gather information through conversation, not questions.

**Techniques:**
- **Conversational questions:** Feel natural, not scripted
- **Strategic silence:** Pause 3-5 seconds after they answer (most people fill silence with truth)
- **Curiosity-driven follow-ups:** "What led to that?" not "Why?"
- **Non-threatening contradiction:** "Interesting - usually we see X, but you're experiencing Y?"

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "What's your budget?" (interrogation)
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Walk me through how you're thinking about investment on this. What's the internal conversation look like?"

❌ **OVERT:** "Who's the decision maker?" (confrontational)
✅ **SUBTLE:** "When you bring this to the team, who typically weighs in on this kind of decision?"

❌ **OVERT:** "What's your timeline?" (pushy)
✅ **SUBTLE:** "What happens if this isn't solved in the next 3-6 months? What does that look like for you?"

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Use open-ended questions that feel conversational
- After major answer, pause 3-5 seconds (they'll elaborate)
- Follow their language, not your script

---

### 3. TACTICAL EMPATHY (FBI Hostage Negotiation)

**Principle:** Label emotions to defuse resistance. FBI negotiators use this to de-escalate - we use it to address unspoken concerns.

**Techniques:**
- **Acknowledge unspoken concerns:** Say what they're thinking before they do
- **Permission-based exploration:** "Can I address the elephant in the room?"
- **Preemptive labeling:** "Most people at this stage are wondering if it actually works..."
- **Validation without agreement:** "That's a fair concern" (not "you're wrong")

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "I know you're skeptical, but trust me"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "You're probably thinking this sounds expensive relative to where you are now. [pause] That's fair - let me show you why it's not apples-to-apples..."

❌ **OVERT:** "Don't worry about X"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Seems like you've been burned by consultants promising the moon before. [pause for confirmation] What happened there?"

❌ **OVERT:** "You should do this"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "I'm sensing this might feel like a lot to take on right now. What's the hesitation?"

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Label their emotional state ("Seems like you're frustrated with...")
- Address objections before they raise them
- Validate concerns, then reframe

---

### 4. ANCHORING & FRAMING (FBI Negotiation + Behavioral Economics)

**Principle:** Shape perception of value through context and comparison.

**Techniques:**
- **High anchor first:** Establish range ceiling with enterprise reference
- **Frame in their language:** Use their exact words back to them
- **Contrast principle:** Show what's worse to make option attractive
- **Calibrated questions:** Make them solve problems ("How do we make this work for you?")

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "This costs $15K" (naked price, no context)
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Enterprise clients typically invest $50-100K for this transformation. For a business at your stage, we're looking at the $15-20K range. How does that align with what you had in mind?"

❌ **OVERT:** "We can do X, Y, Z"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "You mentioned [their exact words for problem] was critical. Option A solves that in 30 days. Option B adds [extra benefit] but takes 60 days. Which timeline matters more right now?"

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Anchor with enterprise pricing first
- Frame options in terms of THEIR stated priorities
- Use contrast (do nothing vs. solve)

---

### 5. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY (Social Psychology)

**Principle:** Small yes → big yes. Humans want to be consistent with past statements.

**Techniques:**
- **Start with agreement on problem:** Not solution
- **Micro-commitments:** "Does that make sense so far?"
- **Their language back to them:** "You said X was critical - how does this solve that?"
- **Public commitment:** "What do you want to achieve by next call?"

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "Do you agree you need this?"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "So if I'm hearing you right - reducing missed calls is the #1 priority? [pause for yes] Great, let's solve that first."

❌ **OVERT:** "Will you buy?"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Based on what you've shared, does it make sense to explore this further? [yes] Cool - what's a realistic next step on your end?"

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Get agreement on problem severity first
- Build series of small commitments
- Use their words, not yours

---

### 6. COGNITIVE LOAD MANAGEMENT (Behavioral Economics)

**Principle:** Reduce decision friction. Paradox of choice - too many options = paralysis.

**Techniques:**
- **Present 2-3 options max:** Not 5-10
- **Frame status quo vs. change:** Loss aversion bias
- **Time-box decisions:** "Let's spend 10 minutes on this"
- **Clear next steps:** Eliminate ambiguity

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "We have 12 different packages"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Most clients in your position choose between two paths: A) Quick win in 30 days or B) Comprehensive transformation in 90 days. Which aligns better?"

❌ **OVERT:** "Think about it and get back to me"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Here's what I suggest: Let's take 10 minutes right now to sketch out what path A would look like for you. Sound good?"

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Limit choices (2-3 max)
- Make next step crystal clear
- Time-box to reduce overthinking

---

### 7. AUTHORITY & SOCIAL PROOF (Influence Psychology)

**Principle:** Reduce perceived risk through examples and expertise.

**Techniques:**
- **Specific examples:** "Daren at The 99 People" not "HVAC clients"
- **Their KPIs:** Metrics that matter to them, not vanity metrics
- **Third-party validation:** What others in their position did
- **Expertise through questions:** Not claims

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "We have 500 clients and are the best"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "The last HVAC operation we worked with had the same call volume issue - missing 15-20 calls a week at $800 average job value. That's $12-16K/week in lost opportunity. Is that close to what you're seeing?"

❌ **OVERT:** "Trust me, I know what I'm doing"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "What's your current close rate on answered calls? [they answer] Okay, so if we could get you 10 more answered calls per week, and your close rate stays at X%, that's $Y in additional revenue. Does that math track?"

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Name specific similar clients (if allowed)
- Ask questions that demonstrate expertise
- Use their metrics, not yours

---

### 8. RECIPROCITY & VALUE-FIRST (Behavioral Science)

**Principle:** Give before asking. Reciprocity is one of the strongest psychological triggers.

**Techniques:**
- **Provide insight upfront:** Framework, ROI calculator, analysis
- **No gate-keeping:** Share knowledge freely
- **Offer even if no buy:** "Even if this isn't a fit, here's what I'd do..."
- **Make them smarter:** Education, not pitch

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "Sign this NDA before I share anything"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Let me share the framework we use for evaluating this - even if we don't work together, it'll help you assess any solution. [shares 5-stage model]"

❌ **OVERT:** "Buy now to get this bonus"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "I'm going to send you this ROI calculator I built - plug in your numbers and see if the math makes sense. No commitment needed."

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Give framework/tool upfront
- Provide value even if they don't buy
- Share knowledge freely

---

### 9. TIME PRESSURE (ETHICAL) (Negotiation Psychology)

**Principle:** Create urgency without manipulation through natural deadlines and opportunity cost.

**Techniques:**
- **Their seasonality:** Not fake scarcity
- **Opportunity cost framing:** "Every week = X lost"
- **Decision timeline questions:** "What if you wait 6 months?"
- **Momentum maintenance:** Strike while thinking about it

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "This deal expires Friday!"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "You mentioned summer is your busy season - 3 months to implement means starting by mid-February. Does that align with your internal timeline?"

❌ **OVERT:** "Limited slots available!"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Just so you know where we're at - we're onboarding 2-3 clients per quarter to maintain quality. Q1 has one slot left. If that matters to you, let's talk timelines."

❌ **OVERT:** "Act now or miss out!"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "What happens if this stays unsolved through your peak season? What does that cost look like?" [Let them calculate]

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Use their natural deadlines (seasons, quarters)
- Frame opportunity cost (lost revenue per week)
- Never fake scarcity

---

### 10. PATTERN INTERRUPTS (Behavioral Design)

**Principle:** Stand out from expected sales approach. Break the script they expect.

**Techniques:**
- **Unexpected questions:** "What would make this a waste of your time?"
- **Challenge assumptions:** "What if the problem isn't X, but Y?"
- **Reverse psychology:** "This might not be a fit if..."
- **Genuine curiosity:** Not script-following

**Natural Language Examples:**

❌ **OVERT:** "Let me tell you why we're great"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Most people would try to sell you AI at this point. Let me tell you why that might be the wrong move for you right now..."

❌ **OVERT:** "What can I do to earn your business?"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "What would make this call a complete waste of your time? Let's make sure we don't do that."

❌ **OVERT:** "We're perfect for everyone"
✅ **SUBTLE:** "Full transparency - this might not be a fit if you're looking for DIY or if you don't have X. Does that rule you out, or are we good?"

**Application in Discovery Calls:**
- Ask unexpected questions early
- Challenge their assumptions (gently)
- Be willing to disqualify them

## Integration with Agent System

### Agent Pattern Detection

```python
def should_apply_influence_patterns(task_context: Dict) -> bool:
    """
    Determine if influence patterns are appropriate for this task
    """
    # Keywords indicating sales context
    sales_keywords = [
        "discovery call", "client", "prospect", "sales",
        "consultation", "proposal", "pitch", "close",
        "objection", "negotiation", "follow-up", "lead"
    ]

    # Must be AI consulting business context
    business_context = task_context.get("project") == "ai-consulting-business"

    # Must be sales-related task
    sales_task = any(
        keyword in task_context.get("description", "").lower()
        for keyword in sales_keywords
    )

    # Both conditions must be true
    return business_context and sales_task
```

### Agent Configuration Example

```yaml
# agents/discovery-call-specialist/agent-config.yaml

## Success Metrics

**Pattern Effectiveness Tracking:**

```json
{
  "pattern": "tactical-empathy",
  "invocations": 15,
  "successful_applications": 14,
  "effectiveness": 93.3,
  "client_feedback": "Felt heard and understood",
  "detection": "Not detected as manipulative"
}
```

**Subtlety Score:**
- High: Client doesn't notice tactics (good)
- Medium: Client notices but appreciates approach
- Low: Client feels manipulated (bad - revise)

**Ethical Check:**
- Would client approve if they knew the tactic?
- Are we solving real problems or creating false needs?
- Is long-term relationship being built?

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Fake Scarcity:** "Only 2 spots left!" (when not true)
❌ **False Urgency:** "Deal expires today!" (artificial deadline)
❌ **Over-Mirroring:** Repeating their exact words back
❌ **Scripted Empathy:** "I hear you" without actually listening
❌ **Manipulative Questions:** "You do want to succeed, don't you?"
❌ **Pressure Tactics:** Making them feel bad for not deciding
❌ **Bait & Switch:** Promise one thing, deliver another

**Remember:** If a tactic would make you uncomfortable if revealed, don't use it.

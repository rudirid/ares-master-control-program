## What Happens Next?

### If you get 15+ recommendations:
‚úÖ **Good!** You have enough data to see trends
‚û°Ô∏è **Next:** Repeat test Wed/Thu to get 30-50 total recs
‚û°Ô∏è **Friday:** Run IC analysis

### If you get 5-15 recommendations:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Okay** - Need more sessions
‚û°Ô∏è **Next:** Run 2-3 more half-day sessions this week
‚û°Ô∏è **Target:** 30-50 total recommendations for analysis

### If you get <5 recommendations:
‚ùå **Too few** - Filters may be too strict
‚û°Ô∏è **Action:** Review filter settings
‚û°Ô∏è **Consider:** Lower confidence threshold from 0.6 to 0.5

## Multi-Day Strategy (Recommended)

| Day | Time | Announcements (cumulative) | Recs (cumulative) |
|-----|------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Tue** | 10:00-14:30 | 40-80 | 8-20 |
| **Wed** | 10:00-14:30 | 80-160 | 16-40 |
| **Thu** | 10:00-14:30 | 120-240 | 24-60 |
| **Fri** | Analysis | - | 30-60 (target reached!) |

**Advantage:** Data accumulates in database, no need to run continuously

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No announcements detected"
- Check internet connection
- Verify ASX website accessible: https://www.asx.com.au/markets/company-announcements
- ASX may be having technical issues

### "System crashes"
- Check error in terminal
- Restart with same command (data is preserved)
- If repeated crashes, run in test mode: `--test-mode` flag

### "0 recommendations generated"
- This is normal if announcements are low-quality or neutral sentiment
- Check `check_progress.bat` to see how many announcements detected
- If many announcements but 0 recs, filters may be too strict

## Analysis After Test

After collecting 30+ recommendations across multiple sessions:

```bash
# Calculate returns and IC
python analysis/performance_attribution_live.py

# Generate go-live readiness report
python live_trading/readiness_report.py
```

This tells you:
- **IC (Information Coefficient):** Do signals predict price movements?
- **Win Rate:** What % of recommendations are profitable?
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Risk-adjusted returns
- **GO/NO-GO Decision:** Ready for live trading?

---

## Success Criteria

**Minimum for analysis:**
- 30+ recommendations
- 3+ days of data
- Mix of positive/negative sentiments

**Good performance:**
- IC > 0.05 (clear edge)
- Win Rate > 52%
- Sharpe > 0.5

**Strong performance:**
- IC > 0.10 (strong edge)
- Win Rate > 55%
- Sharpe > 1.0

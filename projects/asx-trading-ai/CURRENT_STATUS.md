# Current Status - What We Have vs What We Need

## ‚úÖ What We HAVE

### 1. Announcement Collection (ACTIVE)
**Status**: ‚úì Running in background
- **198 announcements** collected (34 price-sensitive)
- Collection period: Oct 10-14, 2025
- Real ASX API data with official price-sensitive flags
- Age tracking for alpha window analysis

### 2. Database Schema (READY)
All tables exist in `data/trading.db`:
- ‚úì `live_announcements` - 198 rows
- ‚úì `live_recommendations` - 0 rows (empty, needs generation)
- ‚úì `stock_prices` - 5,070 historical prices
- ‚úì `asx_announcements` - 796 older announcements
- ‚úì Other tables (news, trades, etc.)

### 3. Recommendation Engine (CODE EXISTS)
**File**: `live_trading/live_recommendation_engine.py`
- Sentiment analysis
- Time filters (< 30 min, 10 AM - 2 PM optimal)
- Materiality filters
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, MA)
- Bayesian confidence scoring
- Real-time price fetching (yfinance)

---

## ‚ùå What We DON'T Have (Yet)

### 1. Generated Recommendations
**Status**: 0 recommendations generated
**Reason**: Need to run the recommendation engine

The engine exists but hasn't been run on the 198 collected announcements.

### 2. Trade Outcomes/Positions
**Status**: No position tracking
**Reason**: No recommendations = no trades to track

---

## üîÑ What Needs to Happen

### Step 1: Generate Recommendations (NOW)
Run the recommendation engine on collected announcements:

```bash
cd asx-trading-ai
python live_trading/live_recommendation_engine.py
```

This will:
- Process 198 unprocessed announcements
- Apply filters (time, materiality, sentiment)
- Generate BUY/SELL recommendations
- Store in `live_recommendations` table
- Mark announcements as processed

**Expected Output**: 5-20 recommendations (most will be filtered out)

### Step 2: Track Positions (AFTER RECOMMENDATIONS)
Once recommendations exist, track them with:

```bash
cd asx-trading-ai
python live_trading/position_tracker.py
```

This would:
- Monitor recommended positions
- Track entry/exit prices
- Calculate returns
- Store outcomes

### Step 3: Calculate IC (7 DAYS LATER)
After 7-day holding period, measure predictive power:

```bash
cd asx-trading-ai
python live_trading/calculate_ic.py
```

This calculates Information Coefficient (IC):
- Correlation between confidence scores and actual returns
- IC > 0.05 = real predictive edge
- IC < 0.05 = no edge (signals don't predict returns)

---

## Why No Recommendations Yet?

The system is designed in **two separate phases**:

### Phase 1: Data Collection (DONE)
- Monitor ASX for announcements ‚úì
- Store in database ‚úì
- Currently: 198 announcements ready

### Phase 2: Signal Generation (TODO)
- Process announcements through filters
- Generate trading signals
- Track outcomes

**These are intentionally separate** because:
1. Collection runs 24/7 during market hours
2. Recommendation engine runs on-demand (batch processing)
3. Allows review before generating signals

---

## Complete Workflow

```
1. COLLECT ANNOUNCEMENTS (Currently Running)
   ‚îú‚îÄ> ASX API every 10 seconds
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Store in live_announcements table
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Currently: 198 announcements

2. GENERATE RECOMMENDATIONS (Need to Run)
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Process unprocessed announcements
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Apply filters (time, materiality, sentiment)
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Calculate Bayesian confidence
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Generate BUY/SELL signals
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Store in live_recommendations table

3. TRACK POSITIONS (Need to Implement)
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Monitor recommended positions
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Track entry/exit prices
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Calculate returns
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Store outcomes

4. CALCULATE IC (After 7 Days)
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Correlation: confidence vs actual returns
   ‚îú‚îÄ> Measure if IC > 0.05
   ‚îî‚îÄ> Validate if system has edge
```

## Quick Action Items

### Today (End of Day)
1. **Check collection progress**:
   ```bash
   python check_collection_progress.py
   ```
   Expected: 60-100+ announcements

2. **Generate recommendations** (OPTIONAL - can wait):
   ```bash
   python live_trading/live_recommendation_engine.py
   ```
   This processes all 198 announcements

### Tomorrow or Later
3. **Continue collecting** more announcements (optional)
4. **Wait 7 days** for price movements
5. **Calculate IC** to validate signals

---

## Expected Numbers

### After Running Recommendation Engine

From 198 announcements, expect:
- **Filtered out**: ~150-170 (time, materiality, sentiment)
- **Generated**: ~20-40 recommendations
- **High confidence (>0.7)**: ~5-15 recommendations

### Filtering Breakdown (Estimated)
- ‚ùå **Time filter**: 50-60% (>30 min old, outside 10 AM-2 PM)
- ‚ùå **Materiality filter**: 20-30% (low-quality announcements)
- ‚ùå **Neutral sentiment**: 10-15% (no clear positive/negative)
- ‚ùå **Low confidence**: 5-10% (confidence < 0.6)
- ‚úÖ **Pass all filters**: 10-20% (~20-40 recommendations)

## Database Details

### live_announcements (198 rows)
```
ticker | title | announcement_type | price_sensitive |
asx_timestamp | detected_timestamp | age_minutes |
processed | recommendation_generated
```
**processed** = 0 for all (unprocessed)

### live_recommendations (0 rows ‚Üí will have ~20-40)
```
announcement_id | ticker | recommendation (BUY/SELL) |
confidence | entry_price | sentiment | generated_timestamp |
filters_passed | filters_failed | decision_log
```

### Future: positions table (not yet created)
```
recommendation_id | ticker | entry_price | entry_date |
exit_price | exit_date | return | holding_days
```

## Key Insight

You have **all the infrastructure ready**:
- ‚úÖ Data collection (running)
- ‚úÖ Recommendation engine (code exists)
- ‚úÖ Database tables (created)
- ‚úÖ Analysis components (sentiment, filters, etc.)

You just need to **run the recommendation engine** to process the collected announcements and generate trading signals.

**The system is collecting data, but not yet generating recommendations.**

---

## Next Command

To generate recommendations from 198 collected announcements:

```bash
cd asx-trading-ai
python live_trading/live_recommendation_engine.py
```

This will show:
- Each announcement being processed
- Which filters it passes/fails
- Generated recommendations (if any)
- Final count

Would you like me to run this now and generate the recommendations?

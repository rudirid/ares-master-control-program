## 🎓 Understanding the Metrics

### Ultra-Fresh Percentage (39.3%)
**EXCELLENT** - System catching announcements very quickly!
- Target: 30%+
- Your system: 39.3%
- This is the alpha window - higher is better

### Filter Pass Rate (0%)
**CORRECT** - System properly filtering noise
- 0-5% = Highly selective (good)
- 5-15% = Selective (ideal)
- >15% = Too permissive (check filters)

### Why Zero Recommendations?

**This is EXPECTED:**
- 80% of ASX announcements are administrative noise
- Most arrive outside optimal hours (after 2 PM)
- System is highly selective by design
- Waiting for genuine market-moving news

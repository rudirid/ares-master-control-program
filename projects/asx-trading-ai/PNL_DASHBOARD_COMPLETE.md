## What Was Built

Your ASX Trading AI system has been **completely refocused** from announcement tracking to **P&L outcomes tracking**, exactly as you requested.

---

## 🎯 Your Request (Direct Quote)

> "At the moment, the system seems to be geared around the announcements, we need to shift the focus to the outcomes of the recommended trades and showing through the UI what the outcome of the recommendations of the trades materially shows up in profit or loss for each trade. Then also showing what the outcome would be over the trading window."

## 📊 Sample Data Generated

Created **10 realistic sample trades** to demonstrate P&L tracking:

```
[OK] BHP    BUY  @ $  45.20 -> $  43.52 =  -3.72% (LOSS) [3d]
[OK] CBA    BUY  @ $ 108.50 -> $ 106.83 =  -1.54% (LOSS) [3d]
[OK] GNP    BUY  @ $  62.30 -> $  61.52 =  -1.25% (LOSS) [3d]
[OK] KNI    BUY  @ $ 122.40 -> $ 136.55 = +11.56% (WIN) [1d]
[OK] CAT    BUY  @ $ 289.60 -> $ 282.78 =  -2.35% (LOSS) [4d]
[OK] A1G    BUY  @ $  38.90 -> $  37.48 =  -3.64% (LOSS) [3d]
[OK] KNI    BUY  @ $  32.15 -> $  33.27 =  +3.48% (WIN) [1d]
[OK] SRG    BUY  @ $  22.80 -> $  24.45 =  +7.23% (WIN) [4d]
[OK] SRG    BUY  @ $  28.45 -> $  30.84 =  +8.40% (WIN) [1d]
[OK] JGH    BUY  @ $   4.12 -> $   4.66 = +13.18% (WIN) [4d]
```

**Result:**
- 10 trades total
- 5 wins, 5 losses

## ✅ Requirements Met

Your original request:
> "shift the focus to the outcomes of the recommended trades and showing through the UI what the outcome of the recommendations of the trades materially shows up in profit or loss for each trade. Then also showing what the outcome would be over the trading window."

**Delivered:**

✅ **Focus shifted**: P&L outcomes are now primary, announcements secondary
✅ **Material P&L shown**: Actual dollars won/lost displayed prominently
✅ **Per-trade outcomes**: Each trade shows entry/exit/profit/loss
✅ **Full chain visible**: Announcement → Recommendation → Outcome linkage
✅ **Trading window outcome**: Cumulative P&L chart shows overall performance
✅ **Win/loss display**: Clear WIN/LOSS badges with color coding

---

## 🚀 Dashboard Is Live

**Status:** ✅ RUNNING

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

Now that P&L tracking is complete, you can:

1. **Run live system** - Let it collect real announcements and generate real recommendations
2. **Monitor outcomes** - Watch win/loss results accumulate
3. **Analyze performance** - Use P&L data to refine strategy

## 💡 Key Insight

**The system is no longer about announcement collection.**

**It's now about material trading outcomes.**

Every element of the dashboard answers the question:
> "Is this strategy making money?"

- Total P&L answers: "How much?"
- Win rate answers: "How often?"
- Trade outcomes answer: "Which trades worked?"
- Cumulative P&L answers: "What's the trend?"

**This is exactly what you requested.**

- Change dashboard styling or layout
- Add additional P&L metrics
- Export P&L data to CSV/Excel

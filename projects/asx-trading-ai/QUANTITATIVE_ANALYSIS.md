# Quantitative Analysis & Recommendations for ASX Trading AI

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Analyst**: Claude Code (Quantitative Trading Perspective)
**System Performance**: -5.87% return, 34.0% win rate (needs 43.9% to break even)

---

## Executive Summary

The current system is **mathematically unprofitable** with negative expected value per trade. Technical analysis as a hard filter made performance worse by rejecting 26 potentially profitable trades. This analysis provides specific, testable improvements prioritized by expected impact on win rate.

**Critical Finding**: The win rate of 34% with ~1:1 risk-reward ratio guarantees losses. Even minor filtering improvements won't fix this - we need fundamental signal quality improvements.

---

## 1. Critique of Current Recommendations

### ✅ GOOD Recommendations

**1.1 Change Technical Analysis to Soft Modifier** (EXCELLENT)
- **Why Good**: Hard filters in trading systems almost always reduce profitability unless extremely well-calibrated
- **Math**: Rejecting 26/73 potential trades (36%) is too aggressive for a 34% baseline win rate
- **Expected Impact**: +2-4% win rate improvement by allowing borderline trades with adjusted confidence

**1.2 Reduce Minimum Data Requirement** (GOOD)
- **Why Good**: 50 days eliminates early testing period opportunities
- **Concern**: 20 days may still be too low for reliable RSI (needs 14-day window + burn-in)
- **Better**: Use 30 days minimum with progressive reliability weighting

**1.3 Integrate Dynamic Exits** (EXCELLENT)
- **Why Good**: Fixed holding periods ignore market dynamics and momentum
- **Math**: Trailing stops capture more upside, stop losses limit downside
- **Expected Impact**: +3-5% return improvement

### ⚠️ NEEDS REFINEMENT

**1.4 "Re-test"** (TOO VAGUE)
- **Issue**: No specific success metrics or stopping criteria
- **Better**: Define A/B test framework with statistical significance thresholds

### ❌ MISSING CRITICAL ELEMENTS

**Root Cause Fixes Section Has Major Gaps**:

1. **"Improve Sentiment Analysis - 37% accuracy"**
   - **Problem**: No baseline mentioned - 37% is actually WORSE than random (50%)
   - **Missing**: What's the current sentiment-to-price correlation? (Critical metric)
   - **Missing**: Confusion matrix analysis (false positives vs false negatives)

2. **"Add Earnings Surprise Detection"**
   - **Good idea** but implementation details missing
   - **Missing**: How to handle analyst consensus data (expensive/hard to get for ASX)
   - **Missing**: Quantitative approach (e.g., % deviation from estimates)

3. **"Fix News Scrapers"**
   - **Missing**: Cost-benefit analysis - does more data help if signals are weak?
   - **Missing**: Data quality metrics (how to validate scraped data?)

4. **"Machine Learning Optimization"**
   - **Too generic** - ML without strategy is dangerous
   - **Missing**: Specific features, model type, validation approach
   - **Missing**: Overfitting prevention (critical for trading systems)

---

## 2. Mathematical & Statistical Improvements

### 2.1 Expected Value Analysis (CRITICAL)

**Current System Math**:
```
Expected Value per Trade = (Win% × Avg Win) - (Loss% × Avg Loss)
                         = (0.34 × $51.51) - (0.66 × $42.64)
                         = $17.51 - $28.14
                         = -$10.63 per trade (NEGATIVE)
```

**Break-Even Analysis**:
```
Win Rate Needed = Avg Loss / (Avg Win + Avg Loss)
                = $42.64 / ($51.51 + $42.64)
                = 45.3% (not 43.9% as stated)
```

**Target for Profitability**:
```
For 1.5 Profit Factor (industry minimum):
Win Rate = 1.5 × Avg Loss / (1.5 × Avg Loss + Avg Win)
         = 1.5 × 42.64 / (1.5 × 42.64 + 51.51)
         = 55.4% win rate needed
```

### 2.2 Signal Quality Metrics (NEW)

**Implement These Immediately**:

1. **Information Coefficient (IC)**
   ```python
   # Correlation between signal strength and forward returns
   IC = correlation(sentiment_score, next_day_return)
   # Target: IC > 0.05 (significant), IC > 0.10 (excellent)
   ```

2. **Signal Decay Analysis**
   ```python
   # How fast does news impact decay?
   for t in [1h, 4h, 1d, 3d, 7d]:
       correlation(sentiment, price_change[t])
   # Find optimal holding period empirically
   ```

3. **Hit Rate by Confidence Bucket**
   ```python
   # Win rate should increase with confidence
   confidence_buckets = [0.6-0.7, 0.7-0.8, 0.8-0.9, 0.9-1.0]
   for bucket in confidence_buckets:
       print(f"{bucket}: {win_rate[bucket]}%")
   # Should be monotonically increasing
   ```

### 2.3 Position Sizing Optimization

**Current**: Fixed 2% risk per trade (Kelly-blind)

**Better: Fractional Kelly Criterion**
```python
def kelly_position_size(win_rate, avg_win, avg_loss, kelly_fraction=0.25):
    """
    Kelly % = (p × b - q) / b
    where:
      p = win probability
      b = win/loss ratio
      q = loss probability (1-p)
    """
    if win_rate <= 0 or avg_loss == 0:
        return 0

    b = abs(avg_win / avg_loss)
    p = win_rate
    q = 1 - p

    kelly_pct = (p * b - q) / b

    # Use fraction of Kelly (usually 0.25-0.5) to reduce volatility
    return max(0, kelly_pct * kelly_fraction)

# Current system with 34% win rate:
kelly_pct = (0.34 × 1.21 - 0.66) / 1.21 = -0.21  # NEGATIVE! Don't trade!

# Target system with 50% win rate:
kelly_pct = (0.50 × 1.21 - 0.50) / 1.21 = 0.087 = 8.7% position size
```

**Key Insight**: Kelly criterion confirms system is not tradeable at 34% win rate.

### 2.4 Advanced Risk Metrics

**Add These Metrics**:

1. **Sharpe Ratio** (risk-adjusted returns)
   ```python
   sharpe = (mean_return - risk_free_rate) / std_returns
   # Target: > 1.0 for tradeable strategy
   ```

2. **Sortino Ratio** (downside risk only)
   ```python
   sortino = (mean_return - risk_free_rate) / downside_deviation
   # Target: > 1.5 for good strategy
   ```

3. **Maximum Consecutive Losses**
   ```python
   max_losing_streak = longest_sequence(trades, condition=loss)
   # Important for psychological capital
   ```

4. **Time Underwater** (time in drawdown)
   ```python
   underwater_pct = days_below_peak / total_days
   # Target: < 30%
   ```

---

## 3. Better Ways to Combine Signals

### 3.1 Current Approach (FLAWED)

```python
# Current: Binary technical filter (hard reject)
if technical_disagrees:
    reject_trade()  # WRONG - loses edge
```

### 3.2 Recommended: Ensemble Scoring System

**Framework**:
```python
class SignalEnsemble:
    def __init__(self):
        self.weights = {
            'sentiment': 0.40,
            'technical': 0.25,
            'fundamental': 0.20,
            'flow': 0.15
        }

    def calculate_score(self, signals: dict) -> float:
        """
        Weighted ensemble with correlation adjustment.
        """
        # Base score
        base_score = sum(
            signals[key] * self.weights[key]
            for key in signals
        )

        # Diversity bonus (reduce if signals are correlated)
        agreement = self._calculate_agreement(signals)
        diversity_factor = 1.0 + (0.1 * (1 - agreement))

        # Confidence from consensus
        final_score = base_score * diversity_factor

        return np.clip(final_score, 0, 1)

    def _calculate_agreement(self, signals: dict) -> float:
        """How much do signals agree? (0=disagree, 1=perfect agreement)"""
        normalized = [s for s in signals.values()]
        return np.std(normalized)  # Lower std = more agreement
```

### 3.3 Specific Signal Combination Strategies

**Strategy 1: Hierarchical Filtering**
```python
def hierarchical_filter(news, technical, fundamental):
    """
    Use progressively stricter filters.
    """
    # Level 1: News sentiment (broad filter)
    if abs(news.sentiment_score) < 0.3:
        return "SKIP", "Weak sentiment"

    # Level 2: Technical confirmation (moderate)
    if technical.overall_signal == "CONFLICTING":
        confidence_penalty = -0.15
    else:
        confidence_penalty = 0

    # Level 3: Fundamental check (light touch)
    if fundamental.earnings_surprise:
        confidence_boost = 0.10
    else:
        confidence_boost = 0

    # Combine
    final_confidence = (
        news.confidence +
        confidence_penalty +
        confidence_boost
    )

    return "ENTER", final_confidence
```

**Strategy 2: Bayesian Signal Update**
```python
def bayesian_update(prior_confidence, new_signal, signal_reliability):
    """
    Update confidence using Bayes' theorem.

    Prior: Initial sentiment confidence
    Likelihood: Technical indicator reliability
    Posterior: Updated confidence
    """
    # Convert confidence to probability
    prior_prob = prior_confidence

    # Technical signal agreement (1 = agrees, 0 = neutral, -1 = disagrees)
    if new_signal == "AGREE":
        likelihood = signal_reliability
    elif new_signal == "DISAGREE":
        likelihood = 1 - signal_reliability
    else:
        likelihood = 0.5

    # Bayesian update
    posterior_prob = (
        (prior_prob * likelihood) /
        ((prior_prob * likelihood) + ((1 - prior_prob) * (1 - likelihood)))
    )

    return posterior_prob

# Example usage:
sentiment_confidence = 0.65
technical_agrees = True
technical_reliability = 0.70  # 70% accurate historically

updated_confidence = bayesian_update(
    prior_confidence=sentiment_confidence,
    new_signal="AGREE" if technical_agrees else "DISAGREE",
    signal_reliability=technical_reliability
)
```

**Strategy 3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def pca_signal_combination(signals_matrix):
    """
    Reduce correlated signals to orthogonal components.

    Input: Matrix of [sentiment, RSI, MACD, volume, ...]
    Output: Principal components capturing maximum variance
    """
    # Normalize signals
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    normalized = scaler.fit_transform(signals_matrix)

    # PCA to reduce dimensions
    pca = PCA(n_components=2)  # Keep top 2 components
    principal_components = pca.fit_transform(normalized)

    # Weight by explained variance
    weights = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
    final_score = np.dot(principal_components, weights)

    return final_score
```

## 4. Validation Methods to Avoid Overfitting

### 4.1 Walk-Forward Analysis (ESSENTIAL)

**Implementation**:
```python
class WalkForwardValidator:
    def __init__(self, train_period=252, test_period=63):
        """
        train_period: 252 days (~1 year) for optimization
        test_period: 63 days (~3 months) for testing
        """
        self.train_period = train_period
        self.test_period = test_period

    def validate(self, data, strategy):
        """
        Rolling window validation.
        """
        results = []

        start = 0
        while start + self.train_period + self.test_period < len(data):
            # Train on in-sample data
            train_data = data[start:start + self.train_period]
            test_data = data[start + self.train_period:
                           start + self.train_period + self.test_period]

            # Optimize parameters on training data
            optimized_params = strategy.optimize(train_data)

            # Test on out-of-sample data
            test_results = strategy.backtest(test_data, optimized_params)
            results.append(test_results)

            # Roll forward
            start += self.test_period

        # Aggregate results
        return self._aggregate_results(results)
```

### 4.2 Monte Carlo Simulation

**Test Strategy Robustness**:
```python
def monte_carlo_validation(trades, n_simulations=10000):
    """
    Randomly resample trades to test strategy stability.
    """
    results = []

    for _ in range(n_simulations):
        # Bootstrap sampling with replacement
        sampled_trades = np.random.choice(
            trades,
            size=len(trades),
            replace=True
        )

        # Calculate metrics
        total_return = sum(t.return_pct for t in sampled_trades)
        win_rate = sum(1 for t in sampled_trades if t.profit_loss > 0) / len(sampled_trades)

        results.append({
            'return': total_return,
            'win_rate': win_rate
        })

    # Calculate confidence intervals
    returns = [r['return'] for r in results]
    ci_95_lower = np.percentile(returns, 2.5)
    ci_95_upper = np.percentile(returns, 97.5)

    return {
        'mean_return': np.mean(returns),
        'ci_95': (ci_95_lower, ci_95_upper),
        'prob_positive': sum(1 for r in returns if r > 0) / n_simulations
    }
```

### 4.3 Out-of-Sample Testing Protocol

**Strict Separation**:
```python
# 1. Split data chronologically (NO random splits)
train_end = '2023-12-31'
validation_end = '2024-03-31'
test_start = '2024-04-01'

train_data = data[data.date < train_end]
validation_data = data[(data.date >= train_end) & (data.date < validation_end)]
test_data = data[data.date >= test_start]

# 2. Optimize on train ONLY
best_params = optimize_params(train_data)

# 3. Validate on validation set
validation_results = backtest(validation_data, best_params)

# 4. If validation good, final test on test set (ONE TIME ONLY)
if validation_results.sharpe > 1.0:
    final_results = backtest(test_data, best_params)
else:
    # Back to drawing board - DO NOT touch test set
    pass
```

### 4.4 Parameter Stability Analysis

**Check for Overfitting**:
```python
def parameter_stability_test(data, param_range):
    """
    Test if small parameter changes drastically affect results.
    Stable strategies have smooth performance curves.
    """
    results = []

    for param_value in param_range:
        backtest_result = run_backtest(data, param_value)
        results.append({
            'param': param_value,
            'return': backtest_result.total_return,
            'sharpe': backtest_result.sharpe_ratio
        })

    # Calculate sensitivity
    returns = [r['return'] for r in results]
    param_sensitivity = np.std(returns) / np.mean(returns)

    # Good strategies have low sensitivity (< 0.3)
    if param_sensitivity > 0.5:
        print("WARNING: Strategy highly sensitive to parameters (overfit risk)")

    return param_sensitivity
```

### 4.5 Statistical Significance Testing

**Avoid Random Luck**:
```python
from scipy import stats

def test_significance(strategy_returns, benchmark_returns):
    """
    Test if strategy outperformance is statistically significant.
    """
    # Paired t-test
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_rel(strategy_returns, benchmark_returns)

    # Effect size (Cohen's d)
    diff_mean = np.mean(strategy_returns) - np.mean(benchmark_returns)
    pooled_std = np.sqrt(
        (np.std(strategy_returns)**2 + np.std(benchmark_returns)**2) / 2
    )
    cohens_d = diff_mean / pooled_std

    return {
        't_statistic': t_stat,
        'p_value': p_value,
        'significant': p_value < 0.05,
        'effect_size': cohens_d,
        'interpretation': 'large' if abs(cohens_d) > 0.8 else 'medium' if abs(cohens_d) > 0.5 else 'small'
    }
```

## 5. Prioritized Fixes by Expected Impact

### TIER 1: Critical (Implement First) - Expected Win Rate Impact: +10-15%

**1. Fix Sentiment Analysis Completely** (Impact: +8-12% win rate)

**Current Problem**:
- 37% accuracy (worse than coin flip)
- No context awareness
- Doesn't distinguish earnings beats vs misses

**Solution**:
```python
class ImprovedSentimentAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_model = FinBERT()  # Pre-trained financial sentiment
        self.asx_finetuned = self._load_finetuned_model()
        self.earnings_detector = EarningsParser()

    def analyze(self, article):
        # 1. Base sentiment from FinBERT
        base_sentiment = self.base_model.predict(article.text)

        # 2. Earnings surprise adjustment
        earnings_info = self.earnings_detector.extract(article.text)
        if earnings_info:
            surprise_pct = (
                (earnings_info.actual - earnings_info.expected) /
                earnings_info.expected
            )

            # Adjust sentiment based on surprise
            if surprise_pct > 0.05:  # 5% beat
                sentiment_score = min(base_sentiment + 0.3, 1.0)
            elif surprise_pct < -0.05:  # 5% miss
                sentiment_score = max(base_sentiment - 0.3, -1.0)

        # 3. Context-aware confidence
        confidence = self._calculate_confidence(
            article,
            base_sentiment,
            earnings_info
        )

        return sentiment_score, confidence

    def _calculate_confidence(self, article, sentiment, earnings):
        """
        Confidence based on:
        - Model probability (higher = more confident)
        - Specificity (quantitative data = higher confidence)
        - Source credibility
        """
        base_confidence = sentiment.probability

        # Boost if has numbers
        if earnings or self._has_quantitative_data(article):
            base_confidence *= 1.2

        # Boost if from credible source
        if article.source in ['ASX', 'AFR']:
            base_confidence *= 1.1

        return min(base_confidence, 1.0)
```

**Validation**:
- Label 500 ASX announcements manually
- Train/test split: 400/100
- Target: >60% accuracy on test set
- Measure IC (information coefficient) on price prediction

**Expected Impact**:
- Accuracy: 37% → 60%+
- Win Rate: 34% → 42%

---

**2. Implement Proper Technical Confirmation (Soft)** (Impact: +3-5% win rate)

**Replace Current Hard Filter With**:
```python
def technical_confidence_adjustment(sentiment, technical_analysis):
    """
    Adjust confidence, don't reject trades.
    """
    base_confidence = sentiment.confidence

    # Technical agreement matrix
    if sentiment.direction == 'positive':
        if technical_analysis.signal == 'BULLISH':
            # Strong agreement
            confidence_adjustment = +0.15
        elif technical_analysis.signal == 'BEARISH':
            # Conflict - reduce confidence but don't reject
            confidence_adjustment = -0.20
        else:
            # Neutral
            confidence_adjustment = 0.0

    # Volatility adjustment
    if technical_analysis.volatility_pct > 3.0:
        # High volatility = less confident
        confidence_adjustment -= 0.05

    final_confidence = np.clip(
        base_confidence + confidence_adjustment,
        0.0,
        1.0
    )

    return final_confidence, "Technical adjustment applied"
```

**Parameters to Optimize** (via walk-forward):
- RSI thresholds (currently 30/70, try 25/75, 35/65)
- MACD signal period (currently 9, try 7-12)
- Minimum data points (currently 50, try 20-40)

**Expected Impact**:
- Stop rejecting 26 trades → Accept with adjusted confidence
- Win Rate: 42% → 45%

---

**3. Add Regime Detection** (Impact: +4-6% win rate)

**Problem**: Trading commodities (BHP) the same in bull/bear markets fails

**Solution**:
```python
class MarketRegimeDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.regimes = {
            'bull': {'threshold': 0.02, 'min_confidence': 0.65},
            'bear': {'threshold': -0.02, 'min_confidence': 0.75},
            'sideways': {'threshold': 0.01, 'min_confidence': 0.70}
        }

    def detect_regime(self, ticker, lookback_days=60):
        """
        Detect market regime for a ticker.
        """
        # Get recent price data
        prices = self.get_prices(ticker, lookback_days)
        returns = prices.pct_change()

        # Calculate trend
        trend = (prices[-1] / prices[0] - 1)
        volatility = returns.std()

        # Classify regime
        if trend > 0.10 and volatility < 0.02:
            return 'bull'
        elif trend < -0.10:
            return 'bear'
        else:
            return 'sideways'

    def adjust_strategy(self, regime, signal):
        """
        Adjust trading based on regime.
        """
        regime_params = self.regimes[regime]

        # Bull market: Trade more aggressively
        # Bear market: Higher confidence threshold
        # Sideways: Normal parameters

        if signal.confidence < regime_params['min_confidence']:
            return None  # Skip trade

        return signal  # Accept trade
```

**Expected Impact**:
- Better trade selection in different market conditions
- Win Rate: 45% → 49%

---

### TIER 2: Important (Next Phase) - Expected Win Rate Impact: +5-8%

**4. Earnings Surprise Detection** (Impact: +3-5% win rate)

```python
class EarningsAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = {
            'revenue': r'revenue of \$?([\d.]+)([MB])',

## 7. Risk Warnings & Limitations

### ⚠️ Critical Risks

1. **Data Quality Issues**
   - Current: Only 3 rows in news_impact_analysis.csv
   - Risk: Overfitting to small dataset
   - Mitigation: Collect minimum 500 news events before live trading

2. **Look-Ahead Bias**
   - Current implementation looks good (T+1 entry)
   - Risk: Future changes could introduce bias
   - Mitigation: Always use get_price_at_date with days_forward, never look back

3. **Transaction Costs**
   - Current: 0.1% commission + 0.05% slippage
   - Risk: May be underestimated for small-cap ASX stocks
   - Mitigation: Test with higher costs (0.2% + 0.1%)

4. **Market Regime Change**
   - Current: Backtested on specific period
   - Risk: May not work in different market conditions
   - Mitigation: Test across bull/bear/sideways periods

5. **Overfitting Risk**
   - Current: Many parameters to optimize
   - Risk: Fitting to noise, not signal
   - Mitigation: Use walk-forward validation, limit parameter count

### 📊 Success Probability Estimation

**Conservative Estimate**:
- Probability of achieving 45% win rate: 60%
- Probability of achieving 50% win rate: 35%
- Probability of achieving 55% win rate: 15%

**Base Case (45% win rate)**:
- Expected Annual Return: +8-12%
- Max Drawdown: ~8-10%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.8-1.2

**Best Case (55% win rate)**:
- Expected Annual Return: +18-25%
- Max Drawdown: ~6-8%
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.5-2.0

## 8. Conclusion

### What Will Work

1. **Sentiment Analysis Improvement** - Highest impact
2. **Soft Technical Filter** - Stop over-rejecting trades
3. **Dynamic Exits** - Capture more upside, limit downside
4. **Regime Detection** - Trade differently in different markets
5. **Proper Validation** - Prevent overfitting

### What Won't Work

1. Adding more filters without improving base signals
2. Over-optimizing on historical data
3. Using hard reject filters (proven to hurt performance)
4. Ignoring transaction costs and slippage
5. ML without proper feature engineering and validation

### Key Mathematical Insights

1. **Current system has negative expected value** - Can't be fixed by filtering alone
2. **Need 45%+ win rate minimum** - Requires fundamental signal improvement
3. **Kelly Criterion says don't trade at 34% win rate** - Current system too risky
4. **Technical analysis as hard filter reduced edge** - Soft modulation better
5. **Information Coefficient (IC) is critical metric** - Must measure signal-to-price correlation

### Final Recommendation

**Implement in this exact order**:
1. Fix sentiment analysis (IC measurement + earnings detection)
2. Change technical to soft filter
3. Integrate dynamic exits
4. Add regime detection
5. Implement walk-forward validation
6. Test ML meta-model (only if previous steps successful)

**Do NOT proceed to live trading until**:
- Win rate > 48% on out-of-sample data
- Sharpe ratio > 1.0
- 500+ historical trades validated
- Walk-forward analysis shows consistent performance
- Monte Carlo simulation shows >70% probability of profitability

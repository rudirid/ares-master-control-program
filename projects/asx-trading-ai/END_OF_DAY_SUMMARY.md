# End of Day Collection Summary

## Extended Collection Running

**Status**: ACTIVE ✓
**Started**: 12:58 PM AEST (2025-10-14)
**Duration**: 8 hours (until ~8:58 PM, covers full market close at 4 PM)
**Mode**: Real ASX API data
**Check Interval**: Every 10 seconds

---

## Quick Progress Check

At any time during the day, you can check progress:

### Option 1: Run the Batch File
```
Double-click: CHECK_PROGRESS.bat
```

### Option 2: Run Python Script
```bash
cd asx-trading-ai
python check_collection_progress.py
```

### Option 3: Quick Database Query
```bash
cd asx-trading-ai
sqlite3 stock_data.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as total, SUM(price_sensitive) as sensitive FROM live_announcements;"
```

---

## What's Happening

The system is checking ASX API **every 10 seconds** for new announcements and automatically:
- ✓ Fetching latest 25 announcements from ASX
- ✓ Filtering out duplicates
- ✓ Storing new announcements to database
- ✓ Tracking age (time since ASX published)
- ✓ Recording official price-sensitive flags

---

## Expected Results by End of Day

### Conservative Estimate
- **ASX typically publishes**: 5-15 announcements per hour during market hours
- **Market hours remaining**: ~3 hours (1 PM - 4 PM)
- **Expected new announcements**: 15-45 additional

### Total by 4 PM
- **Already collected**: 49 announcements (from first test)
- **New from this session**: 15-45
- **Estimated total**: 64-94 announcements

### Quality Expectations
- **Price sensitive**: ~15-25% of announcements
- **Fresh (< 5 min age)**: ~30-40% captured in alpha window
- **Unique companies**: 50-70 different tickers

---

## End of Day Checklist

When market closes (4 PM AEST) or end of day, run:

```bash
cd asx-trading-ai
python check_collection_progress.py
```

### What to Look For

1. **Total Announcements**: Should be 60-100+
2. **Price Sensitive Count**: 15-30 announcements
3. **Age Distribution**: Majority < 30 minutes
4. **Unique Companies**: 50+ different tickers

### Success Criteria

✓ **Minimum**: 30+ announcements (ready for IC calculation)
✓ **Good**: 50+ announcements (solid sample size)
✓ **Excellent**: 80+ announcements (high confidence IC)

---

## Next Steps After Collection

### Immediate (Tonight/Tomorrow)
Review data quality and decide:

**Option A: Collect More**
- Run another session tomorrow (10 AM - 2:30 PM)
- Target: 100+ announcements for robust IC calculation

**Option B: Wait for Returns**
- Wait 7 days for stock price movements
- Then calculate Information Coefficient (IC)

### 7 Days Later
Run IC calculation to see if signals have predictive power:

```bash
cd asx-trading-ai
python live_trading/calculate_ic.py
```

**Goal**: IC > 0.05 indicates real edge (correlation between confidence scores and actual returns)

## Monitoring the Background Process

### Check if Running
```bash
# Windows Task Manager
tasklist | findstr python

# Or check process directly
ps aux | grep announcement_monitor
```

### View Live Logs
The monitoring script logs to console (stderr). If you need to see real-time updates, the background process is logging all activity.

### Stop Collection Early
If you need to stop before 8 hours:
```bash
# Find the process ID
tasklist | findstr python

# Kill it
taskkill /PID [process_id] /F
```

## Current Session Details

**Background Process ID**: 4514d5
**Database**: `stock_data.db`
**Table**: `live_announcements`
**API Endpoint**: `asx.api.markitdigital.com/asx-research/1.0/markets/announcements`

## What You've Achieved Today

✅ **Fixed broken ASX scraper** (HTML → API)
✅ **Validated with real data** (49 announcements in 1 hour test)
✅ **Started extended collection** (8-hour session)
✅ **Capturing alpha window** (2-5 minute announcement ages)
✅ **Official price-sensitive flags** (no guessing!)

---

## Technical Notes

### Data Quality Improvements Made Today
1. **Real API data** instead of mock testing
2. **Official isPriceSensitive** flag from ASX
3. **ISO timestamp parsing** (accurate to the second)
4. **Duplicate prevention** via unique document URLs
5. **Age tracking** (detect announcements within 30-90s alpha window)

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE live_announcements (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    ticker TEXT NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    announcement_type TEXT,
    price_sensitive INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    asx_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    detected_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    url TEXT UNIQUE,
    age_minutes REAL
);
```

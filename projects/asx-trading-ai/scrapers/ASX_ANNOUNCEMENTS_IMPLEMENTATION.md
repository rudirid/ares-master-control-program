### 3. Announcement Categorization
Automatically categorizes announcements into:
- Quarterly Report
- Half Year Results
- Full Year Results
- Annual Report
- Trading Update
- Takeover/Scheme
- Capital Raising
- Director Changes
- Substantial Holder
- ASX Query
- Dividend
- Progress Report
- Change in Interest
- General Announcement
- Other

### 4. Helper Functions

#### `parse_asx_datetime(datetime_string)`
Parses ASX date/time formats with intelligent preprocessing:
- Handles missing spaces: "09/10/20255:40 pm" → "09/10/2025 5:40 pm"
- Supports multiple formats: DD/MM/YYYY, DD-Mon-YYYY, ISO formats
- Includes fallback to dateutil parser for edge cases

#### `is_price_sensitive(element)`
Detects price-sensitive announcements by checking for:
- Price sensitive icon: `<img alt="price sensitive">`
- CSS classes: 'price-sensitive', 'priceSensitive'
- Text indicators: asterisk (*) or "price sensitive" text

#### `extract_announcement_from_row(row)`
Parses HTML table rows to extract announcement details with:
- Flexible cell detection
- URL construction for absolute paths
- Company name extraction
- Automatic categorization

#### `categorize_announcement(title)`
Classifies announcements based on keyword matching in titles

#### `fetch_announcement_content(url)`
Fetches full announcement text from detail pages:
- Skips PDF files (would require separate PDF parsing)
- Extracts content from various HTML structures
- Limits content to 10,000 characters
- Respects rate limits

#### `scrape_today_announcements()`
Scrapes the ASX today's announcements page:
- Parses HTML table structure
- Extracts all announcements for the day
- Returns list of announcement dictionaries

#### `scrape_company_announcements(ticker, max_count=20)`
Uses ASX API to get company-specific announcements:
- API endpoint: `https://www.asx.com.au/asx/1/company/{ticker}/announcements`
- Parses JSON response
- Extracts price sensitive flags from API
- Constructs absolute URLs

#### `store_announcement(cursor, announcement, fetch_content=False)`
Stores announcements in database:
- Uses INSERT OR IGNORE for duplicate prevention
- Optional content fetching
- Rate limiting for content requests
- Returns True if inserted, False if duplicate

#### `get_announcements_summary(db_path=None)`
Provides database statistics:
- Total announcements and price sensitive count
- Announcements by type
- Most active companies
- Recent announcements
- Date range coverage

## Scraping Strategy

### Two-Mode Operation

**Mode 1: Today's Announcements (Default)**
- Scrapes the main ASX announcements page
- Gets all announcements for the current day
- Efficient for daily updates
- No ticker list required

**Mode 2: Company-Specific (When tickers provided)**
- Uses ASX API for each ticker
- More detailed announcement data
- Better price sensitive detection
- Respects rate limits (2 seconds between requests)

### HTML Parsing Approach
- **Library:** BeautifulSoup4
- **Method:** Static HTML parsing (no JavaScript required)
- **Structure:** Table-based extraction with flexible row parsing
- **Robustness:** Multiple fallback strategies for data extraction

### Price Sensitive Detection
The scraper identifies price-sensitive announcements through:
1. ASX icon: `<img alt="price sensitive">`
2. CSS classes indicating sensitivity
3. Text markers (asterisk, "price sensitive" label)
4. API flags (when using company-specific mode)

**Note:** The test run showed 0 price-sensitive announcements, which may indicate:
- No price-sensitive announcements released that day (likely)
- Detection logic may need refinement based on actual HTML structure
- Price sensitive announcements may use different marking after market hours

## Rate Limiting & Ethical Scraping

### Rate Limiting
- **Default delay:** 2 seconds between requests (ASX_RATE_LIMIT from config)
- **Content fetching:** Additional 2-second delay per content fetch
- **Configurable:** Adjust in config.py if needed

### Ethical Considerations
- Uses realistic User-Agent (Chrome 120)
- Respects robots.txt (should be verified)
- Implements request delays to avoid server overload
- Handles errors gracefully without retry storms
- Caches results in database to minimize redundant requests

### Error Handling
- Network failures: Logged with context, skipped gracefully
- Parsing errors: Individual announcements skipped, scraping continues
- Database errors: Logged, transaction rolled back
- Timeout handling: 30-second timeout per request (configurable)
- Retry logic: Built into safe_request utility (3 retries with 5-second delay)

## Database Integration

### Table: `asx_announcements`
- **Primary Key:** id (autoincrement)
- **Unique Constraint:** url (prevents duplicates)
- **Indexes:** ticker, datetime, price_sensitive

### Duplicate Handling
- Uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` strategy
- URL is unique constraint
- Silently skips duplicates (logged at debug level)
- Allows safe re-runs without data duplication

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Today's Announcements)
```python
from scrapers.asx_announcements import scrape_asx_announcements

result = scrape_asx_announcements()
print(f"Scraped {result['announcements_scraped']} announcements")
```

### Scrape Specific Tickers
```python
result = scrape_asx_announcements(
    tickers=['BHP', 'CBA', 'WBC', 'NAB'],
    date_from='2025-10-01',
    date_to='2025-10-09'
)
```

### Fetch Full Content (Slower)
```python
result = scrape_asx_announcements(
    fetch_content=True  # Fetches full text from detail pages
)
```

### Get Database Summary
```python
from scrapers.asx_announcements import get_announcements_summary

summary = get_announcements_summary()
print(f"Total announcements: {summary['total_announcements']}")
print(f"Price sensitive: {summary['price_sensitive_count']}")
```

### Standalone Execution
```bash
python scrapers/asx_announcements.py
```
This will:
- Scrape last 7 days of announcements
- Store in database
- Display summary statistics

## Integration with Main System

The scraper integrates with the StockTradingAI system through:

1. **Config Module:** Imports DATABASE_PATH, ASX_RATE_LIMIT, USER_AGENT
2. **Utils Module:** Uses get_logger, safe_request, rate_limit_wait
3. **Database:** Stores in asx_announcements table created by init_db.py
4. **Main Pipeline:** Can be called from main.py for scheduled scraping

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed
- **Today's announcements:** ~2-3 seconds (single page fetch)
- **500 announcements:** ~5-10 seconds (parsing time)
- **With content fetching:** ~1000+ seconds (2 sec × 500 announcements)

### Resource Usage
- **Memory:** Low (streaming HTML parsing)
- **Network:** One request per page/API call
- **Database:** Minimal (indexed queries)

### Scalability
- Can handle thousands of announcements
- Rate limiting prevents overwhelming ASX servers
- Database indexes support efficient queries
- Duplicate detection prevents data bloat

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Date Filtering:** Today's page doesn't support date range queries directly
2. **PDF Content:** PDF announcements not parsed (would require pdfplumber)
3. **Historical Data:** Limited to available ASX pages/API
4. **Price Sensitive:** Detection may need refinement based on actual page structure
5. **JavaScript Content:** Not currently needed, but might be in future

### Potential Enhancements
1. **PDF Parsing:** Add pdfplumber integration for PDF announcements
2. **Historical Scraping:** Implement pagination for historical announcements page
3. **Advanced Filtering:** Add filters for announcement types
4. **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrate NLP for announcement sentiment
5. **Alert System:** Real-time alerts for price-sensitive announcements
6. **Concurrent Scraping:** Multi-threaded scraping for multiple tickers
7. **Content Summarization:** AI-powered summarization of long announcements
8. **Price Impact Analysis:** Correlate announcements with price movements

## Maintenance Considerations

### Website Changes
- **Structure Changes:** Parsing logic may need updates if ASX changes HTML
- **API Changes:** Company API endpoint may change format
- **URL Changes:** Base URLs should be configurable
- **Detection Logic:** Price sensitive markers may change

### Monitoring
- **Log Files:** Check logs/scrapers_asx_announcements.log for errors
- **Success Rate:** Monitor failed_count in results
- **Data Quality:** Verify price_sensitive detection accuracy
- **Database Growth:** Monitor database size (especially with content fetching)

### Recommended Checks
1. Weekly verification of scraping success rate
2. Monthly audit of price sensitive detection accuracy
3. Quarterly review of announcement categorization
4. Annual review of ASX website structure changes

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** DateTime parsing warnings
- **Cause:** ASX format quirks (missing spaces)
- **Solution:** Fixed in parse_asx_datetime() with regex preprocessing
- **Status:** Resolved

**Issue:** No announcements scraped
- **Cause:** Website structure change or network error
- **Solution:** Check logs, verify URL is accessible, inspect HTML structure
- **Command:** `curl https://www.asx.com.au/asx/v2/statistics/todayAnns.do`

**Issue:** Price sensitive count is 0
- **Cause:** No PS announcements that day, or detection logic needs refinement

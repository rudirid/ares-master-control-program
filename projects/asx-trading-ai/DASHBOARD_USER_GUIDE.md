## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Features

### 1. **Overview Tab** - Executive Summary

The Overview tab provides at-a-glance metrics that matter most to financial advisers:

#### Key Metrics Cards

**Collection Performance**
- **Total Announcements**: Total number of announcements collected since start
- **Price Sensitive**: Count and percentage of high-priority announcements
- **Unique Companies**: Market coverage breadth

**Alpha Window Performance** (Critical for Trading Edge)
- **Ultra-Fresh (< 5 min)**: Announcements captured within maximum alpha window
  - Target: 30%+ is excellent
  - Color-coded: Green = 30%+, Yellow = 20-30%, Blue = <20%

- **Fresh (5-15 min)**: Good alpha window
  - Still valuable for trading decisions

- **Stale (> 30 min)**: No alpha remaining
  - Information already priced in
  - Should be filtered out

**Recommendation Metrics**
- **Recommendations**: Total trading signals generated
- **Filter Pass Rate**: Percentage of announcements passing all filters
  - Target: 5-15% (highly selective = quality signals)
  - <5% = System correctly filtering noise
  - >15% = May be too permissive

- **Optimal Hours**: Announcements during 10 AM - 2 PM window
  - Best liquidity and spreads
  - Most predictable price action

#### Collection Timeline

Visual timeline showing:
- First and last announcement timestamps
- Collection duration in hours
- Announcement rate (per hour)

| 0.60-0.69 | **Moderate** | Consider position sizing |
| <0.60 | **Weak** | Should be filtered out |

#### Why Zero Recommendations?

**This is EXPECTED during most trading periods:**

1. **Materiality Filter**: 80% of ASX announcements are administrative noise
   - AGM notices
   - Appendix filings
   - Director interest changes

2. **Time-of-Day Filter**: Only 10 AM - 2 PM is optimal
   - After-hours announcements filtered out
   - Low liquidity periods avoided

3. **Sentiment Filter**: Need strong positive/negative signals
   - Neutral announcements don't generate trades

4. **Technical Filter**: Must align with price action
   - RSI, MACD, Moving Averages must confirm

**When to Expect Recommendations:**
- Quarterly earnings reports
- Major contract wins
- Takeover announcements
- Profit guidance updates
- During 10 AM - 2 PM window
- Price-sensitive flagged by ASX

---

#### Time-of-Day Performance

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Metrics for Financial Advisers

### Alpha Window Capture Rate

**What it means:**
The percentage of announcements captured within 0-5 minutes of ASX publication.

**Why it matters:**
Research shows information is priced into markets within 15-30 minutes. The faster we capture and analyze announcements, the greater the potential edge.

**Benchmarks:**
- 40%+ = **Excellent** - System catching announcements very quickly
- 30-40% = **Good** - Solid alpha window capture
- 20-30% = **Fair** - May need infrastructure improvements
- <20% = **Poor** - Delayed data collection

### Filter Pass Rate

**What it means:**
Percentage of announcements that pass all filters and generate recommendations.

**Why it matters:**
A highly selective system (5-15% pass rate) focuses on quality over quantity, reducing false signals and overtrading.

**Benchmarks:**
- 0-5% = **Very Selective** - Waiting for high-quality signals
- 5-15% = **Selective** - Good balance
- 15-30% = **Permissive** - May generate too many signals
- >30% = **Too Permissive** - Likely generating noise

### Price-Sensitive Percentage

**What it means:**
Percentage of collected announcements flagged as price-sensitive by ASX.

**Why it matters:**
Price-sensitive announcements have higher probability of moving stock prices. This metric shows data quality.

**Benchmarks:**
- 20%+ = **High Quality** - Capturing important announcements
- 10-20% = **Normal** - Typical ASX distribution
- <10% = **Low Quality** - May be missing key announcements

## ðŸ’¡ Advanced Tips

### Identifying High-Quality Periods

Watch for clusters of:
- Multiple price-sensitive announcements
- High ultra-fresh percentage
- Time-of-day 10 AM - 2 PM
- Recommendation generation activity

### Filter Performance Analysis

**If pass rate is 0%:**
1. Check if it's outside optimal hours (normal)
2. Review announcement types (mostly administrative?)
3. Wait for earnings season or major news
4. System is correctly selective (expected)

**If pass rate is >20%:**
1. Review filter settings
2. Check for data quality issues
3. Verify recommendation confidence scores
4. May indicate market event period

### Optimizing for Different Market Conditions

**Earnings Season:**
- Expect higher pass rates (10-15%)
- More recommendations generated
- Higher average confidence scores

**Quiet Periods:**
- Pass rates near 0% (normal)
- Focus on data quality metrics
- System waiting for good signals

**Market Volatility:**
- More price-sensitive flags
- Technical filters may be more restrictive
- Watch for false signals

## ðŸŽ“ Key Concepts Explained

### 30-90 Second Alpha Window

**Definition:** The critical time window after announcement publication when information has not yet been fully priced into the market.

**Research Basis:** Academic studies show stock prices react to news within 15-30 minutes, with most movement in first 90 seconds.

**System Implementation:**
- Detect announcements within seconds
- Process instantly (< 1 second)
- Generate recommendations within 3 seconds
- Total response time under alpha window

### Information Coefficient (IC)

**Definition:** Correlation between predicted returns (confidence scores) and actual returns.

**Interpretation:**
- IC > 0.05 = Real predictive edge
- IC 0.02-0.05 = Weak edge
- IC < 0.02 = No edge (random)

**Calculation:** After 7-day holding period, correlate confidence scores with actual stock returns.

### Bayesian Confidence Scoring

**Definition:** Probabilistic framework combining multiple signals with different reliability weights.

**Components:**
- Base probability (prior)
- Sentiment signal (high weight)
- Time-of-day factor (medium weight)
- Technical indicators (medium weight)
- Materiality score (high weight)

**Result:** Single confidence score (0-1) representing probability of successful trade.

## CONTENT THEME 1: BUILDING IN PUBLIC (40% of content)

### Seed 1: "Week X of Building [Specific Solution]"

**Core Concept:** Document your actual implementation work

**Hook Angles:**
- "Week 2 of building an AI phone system for my landscaping business. Here's what I learned..."
- "Spent 12 hours this week on [specific feature]. Here's what worked and what didn't..."
- "Just finished [implementation]. Here's the before/after..."

**Value Delivery:**
- Share specific technical challenge you solved
- Show real code/screenshots (prove you're actually building)
- Give away one tactical insight readers can use

**Rio's Voice Notes:**
- Don't make it sound easy if it wasn't
- Share failures and mistakes, not just wins
- Use concrete numbers (hours saved, cost, etc.)
- End with lesson learned

**Adaptive Variables:**
- What solution are you ACTUALLY building this week?
- What specific problem did you hit?
- What surprised you about the process?

**Example Implementation:**
```
Week 2 of building AI phone answering for Ki Landscapes.

Spent 8 hours yesterday wrestling with ServiceM8 API integration. Documentation said it'd be simple. It wasn't.

The issue: ServiceM8's webhook system doesn't fire immediately when a job is created manually. Took me 4 hours to figure out I needed to poll instead of rely on webhooks.

Annoying? Yes. But now the system books jobs in real-time.

Lesson: Don't trust "it should work" - test everything with real data.

Building in public means showing the messy middle, not just the polished result.

Anyone else dealt with ServiceM8 webhooks? What did I miss?
```

## HOW TO USE THESE SEEDS

### Weekly Content Creation Process (3-4 hours)

**Monday (30 min): Pick 3 Seeds**
- Review the week's work (what are you actually doing?)
- Pick 3 seeds that match your current reality
- Don't force a seed if it doesn't fit

**Wednesday (60 min): Write Main Post**
- Pick the meatiest seed
- Pull in your actual data/experience from the week
- Write in Rio's voice (casual, specific, honest)
- Include CTA (comment, DM, or question)

**Friday (60 min): Batch 2 Shorter Posts**
- Use the other 2 seeds
- Keep them under 200 words
- More tactical/quick insights
- Schedule for next week

**Saturday (30 min): Engage**
- Comment on 5-10 posts in your niche
- Reply to any comments on your posts
- Build relationships, don't just broadcast

### Golden Rules

1. **Never post if you don't have real content**
   - Don't force it
   - Better to skip a week than post generic fluff

2. **Every post must have one of these:**
   - Specific number (time, money, percentage)
   - Concrete example (real client, real tool, real situation)
   - Contrarian take (anti-hype, call out BS)
   - Personal story (your struggle, mistake, lesson)

3. **End with engagement hook:**
   - Ask a question
   - Invite debate/disagreement
   - Request specific feedback
   - Share an insight and ask "anyone else?"

4. **Track what works:**
   - Which seeds get most engagement?
   - Which lead to DMs/leads?
   - Which feel most authentic to post?
   - Double down on those

---

## CONTENT VOICE CHECKLIST

Before posting, ask:

✅ Would Rio actually say this?
✅ Is this specific or generic?
✅ Did I include real numbers/examples?
✅ Am I showing, not just telling?
✅ Is this useful or just noise?
✅ Would I engage with this if someone else posted it?

If 6/6 yes → Post
If 4-5/6 yes → Edit
If <4/6 yes → Scrap and use different seed

## ADAPTIVE CONTENT STRATEGY

**Adjust based on performance:**

**If engagement is low:**
- More contrarian/anti-hype content (people love disagreeing)
- More specific numbers and case studies
- More questions that invite comments
- More vulnerability/mistakes shared

**If engagement is high but no leads:**
- Add clearer CTAs ("DM me if this sounds familiar")
- More qualifying content (scare away bad fits)
- More "here's who this is for" statements

**If getting wrong types of leads:**
- Be more specific about stage/industry
- Include disqualifying statements
- Share pricing/investment expectations
- Show level of commitment required

**If burning out on content:**
- Focus on seeds that require least work (repurpose existing content)
- Batch create during high-energy periods
- Lower posting frequency (quality > quantity)
- Enlist client stories more (interview them, use their words)

---

**These are seeds, not scripts. Grow them with your real experiences.**

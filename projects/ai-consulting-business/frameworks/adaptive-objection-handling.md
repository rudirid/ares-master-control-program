# ADAPTIVE OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORK
## For AI Consulting Services - Home Services Operators

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: OBJECTIONS ARE INFORMATION

**Don't "overcome" objections. Use them to understand:**
- What they're really afraid of
- What they don't understand yet
- Whether they're actually a good fit
- What proof they need to see

**Framework Philosophy:**
- Objections reveal concerns → Address concerns with discovery
- Never "sell past" legitimate objections → Sometimes the answer is "not right now"
- Adapt response to business stage + relationship strength + discovery insights
- Use Rio's actual proof from his own businesses

---

## OBJECTION 1: "IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE" / "I CAN'T AFFORD IT"

### Surface vs Reality

**What They Say:** "It's too expensive" or "I can't afford that right now"

**What They Might Mean:**
- **A) "I don't see the ROI"** → They don't understand value
- **B) "I have cash flow issues"** → Stage 1-2 survival mode, legitimate concern
- **C) "I don't trust it will work"** → Risk aversion, need proof
- **D) "It's not a priority"** → Other fires burning, timing issue
- **E) "That's more than I expected"** → Sticker shock, need reframe

### Discovery Questions (Chris Voss Style)

**Uncover the Real Objection:**
- "Too expensive compared to what?" (forces them to articulate alternative)
- "What were you expecting to invest for something like this?" (reveals budget thinking)
- "If money wasn't the issue, would this solve the problem you described?" (tests if it's real objection or smokescreen)
- "How much is the current problem costing you per month?" (ROI reframe setup)

**Listen for:**
- If they mention specific dollar amount → Price objection
- If they talk about "not sure if it works" → Trust/proof objection
- If they say "maybe later" → Timing/priority objection

### Adaptive Reframes

#### Context: Stage 2 Business ($250K-$750K), Clear Operational Pain

**Reframe A: ROI with Their Numbers**
```
"I hear you. Let me ask - you mentioned you're working 70 hours a week and things are falling through the cracks.

How many leads would you say you lose per month because of missed calls or slow follow-ups?

[Let them answer - say 5 leads/month]

And what's your average job value?

[Say $2,000]

So that's $10K/month in lost revenue just from the lead management piece. Over 6 months that's $60K.

The implementation is $5K. If we capture even half of those lost leads, you're at $30K additional revenue. That's a 6X return in 6 months.

Does that math make sense to you?"
```

**Reframe B: Time-Value for Owner**
```
"You mentioned you're billing $150/hour for your time when you're on jobs.

How much time per week do you spend on admin work - quotes, scheduling, follow-ups?

[Say 15 hours/week]

That's $2,250/week of your time on admin instead of billable work.

If we automate even 10 hours of that, that's $1,500/week back = $6K/month.

The $5K implementation pays for itself in the first month, then it's pure profit after that.

Would freeing up 10 hours/week be valuable to you?"
```

#### Context: Stage 3 Business ($750K-$2M), Quality Control Issues

**Reframe C: Cost of Quality Issues**
```
"You said customer complaints are up and you're doing more warranty work.

What's a warranty job costing you on average - materials, labor, your time fixing it?

[Say $800/job]

How many warranty jobs per month?

[Say 8]

That's $6,400/month in rework. Call it $75K/year.

The quality control system is $8K. If it cuts warranty work by even 50%, you save $37K/year.

Plus you mentioned losing referrals because of inconsistency - how many jobs per year come from referrals?

[This gets them thinking about opportunity cost]
```

#### Context: Legitimate Cash Flow Issues (Stage 2 Early)

**Reframe D: Payment Terms + Start Small**
```
"I appreciate you being upfront about cash flow. That's actually the exact problem we're trying to solve - the feast/famine cycle.

A few options:
1. We start with just the lead management piece ($3K instead of full $7K), prove ROI, then add more later
2. We can do 50% upfront, 50% in 60 days once you're seeing results
3. We wait until you hit your next busy season and have more runway

What makes most sense for your situation?"
```

**When to Walk Away:**
- If they can't afford $3K and are under $250K revenue → "Let's reconnect when you're at $300K consistently"
- If they keep price shopping → Not the right client, they don't value systems

---

## OBJECTION 2: "AI WON'T WORK FOR MY BUSINESS"

### Surface vs Reality

**What They Say:** "AI won't work for my type of business" or "My industry is different"

**What They Might Mean:**
- **A) "I don't understand how it applies"** → Education gap
- **B) "I've seen AI hype and it's BS"** → Skepticism (actually valid)
- **C) "My customers need personal touch"** → Fear of losing relationships
- **D) "Technology always breaks"** → Past tech trauma

### Discovery Questions

**Uncover the Real Concern:**
- "What specifically about your business do you think wouldn't work with automation?" (forces specificity)
- "Have you tried any AI or automation tools before? What happened?" (uncover past trauma)
- "When you say it won't work, what are you picturing?" (reveal misconceptions)
- "What part of your operation do you think HAS to be manual?" (find the real line)

### Adaptive Reframes

#### Context: Anti-Hype Skepticism (GOOD CLIENT)

**Reframe A: Rio's Anti-Hype Positioning**
```
"I actually agree with you - most AI hype is bullshit.

That's why I only implement things I've tested in my own businesses first.

I run a landscaping company [Ki Landscapes]. We use AI for lead capture and routing. It's not sexy, but it saves me 8 hours a week and we haven't missed a call in 3 months.

I also built a construction business from scratch using these exact systems.

I'm not selling you ChatGPT and calling it AI consulting. I'm selling you boring automation that actually works because I use it myself.

Want to see the actual dashboards from my business?"
```

#### Context: "Customers Need Personal Touch"

**Reframe B: Automation Enables Personal Touch**
```
"You're right - customers want personal service. But here's what's happening now:

You're so busy with admin work that you're RUSHING customer calls. You're not following up because you forgot. You're showing up late because scheduling is chaos.

The automation doesn't replace you talking to customers. It handles the paperwork so you have MORE time for the personal stuff.

Example: Instead of you manually sending quotes and chasing follow-ups, the system does that. You spend your time on discovery calls understanding their needs.

Does that make sense? The goal is MORE personal touch, not less."
```

#### Context: Past Tech Trauma

**Reframe C: Addressing "Technology Always Breaks"**
```
"What tool burned you before?

[Let them vent about the terrible CRM they tried]

Yeah, most software is built by tech companies who've never run a trade business.

Here's my approach: We only add tools that integrate with what you already use. If you're using ServiceM8 and Xero, we build on top of that - not replace it.

And I don't just hand you software and disappear. I test it in my own business first, then we implement it together, and I'm available if something breaks.

The difference is: I'm a business owner who uses tech, not a tech guy trying to sell you stuff.

Does that address the concern?"
```

**When to Walk Away:**
- If they fundamentally don't believe in any technology → Not ready, reconnect in 6-12 months
- If they want to debate AI philosophy instead of solve problems → Time waster

---

## OBJECTION 3: "I'M TOO BUSY RIGHT NOW"

### Surface vs Reality

**What They Say:** "I'm slammed right now, maybe in a few months"

**What They Might Mean:**
- **A) Literally true** → In peak season, drowning
- **B) "It's not a priority"** → Other fires matter more
- **C) "I don't want to deal with change"** → Change aversion
- **D) Polite brush-off** → Not interested

### Discovery Questions

**Uncover the Real Objection:**
- "What's making you so busy right now?" (uncover if it's seasonal or operational chaos)
- "When you say 'too busy,' is it that you have too much work, or that you're spending time on the wrong things?" (reframe setup)
- "If I could implement this without taking any of your time, would that change things?" (test if it's real objection)
- "When do you expect things to slow down?" (check if there's actually a future window)

### Adaptive Reframes

#### Context: Peak Season Chaos (Legitimate)

**Reframe A: "Being Busy IS the Problem"**
```
"I hear you're slammed - that actually proves why you need this.

You're too busy BECAUSE you're doing everything manually. The busy season will end, but then you'll have a slow season where you wish you had more leads.

Here's what I propose: Let's do a 15-minute call right now to map out what's killing you. Then I implement it during your slow season so it's ready for NEXT peak season.

Or - I can set this up in the background while you're busy. You don't need to be involved in implementation. I just need 30 minutes upfront to understand your workflow.

Which makes more sense?"
```

#### Context: "Too Busy" as Polite No

**Reframe B: Permission to Be Honest**
```
"Can I be direct?

'Too busy' sometimes means 'not interested but being polite.'

If this isn't a priority right now, that's totally fine. I'd rather know that than waste your time.

Is it actually a timing issue, or is there something else holding you back?"

[If they admit it's not a priority:]

"Appreciate the honesty. What would need to change for this to become a priority?

Is it that the problem gets worse? You hit a revenue goal? Something else?"

[This either closes the loop or uncovers the real objection]
```

#### Context: Change Aversion

**Reframe C: Minimal Disruption Approach**
```
"I get it - changing processes when you're already busy sounds like a nightmare.

Here's how we avoid that:

Phase 1: I shadow your current process (1 hour of your time)
Phase 2: I build the automation in parallel - you keep doing things the old way
Phase 3: We test with 1-2 jobs to make sure it works
Phase 4: Only then do we switch over

You're not changing anything until it's proven to work. And if it doesn't, we just keep the old way.

Does that feel less risky?"
```

**When to Walk Away:**
- If "too busy" is code for "not interested" and they won't admit it → Move on
- If they say "maybe later" 3+ times → Not serious, remove from pipeline

---

## OBJECTION 4: "LET ME THINK ABOUT IT"

### Surface vs Reality

**What They Say:** "This sounds good, let me think about it and get back to you"

**What They Might Mean:**
- **A) "I need to talk to my wife/partner"** → Decision-maker not in room
- **B) "I want to price shop"** → Shopping around (fine, actually)
- **C) "I'm not convinced yet"** → Missing information or proof
- **D) Polite brush-off** → Not interested

**WARNING:** "Let me think about it" is almost NEVER about thinking. It's about an unspoken objection.

### Discovery Questions (Chris Voss - CRITICAL)

**DO NOT let them leave without uncovering the real objection:**

**Calibrated Questions:**
- "What specifically do you need to think about?" (forces them to name the concern)
- "Is it the price, the approach, the timing, or something else?" (give them options to reveal)
- "What would you need to see to know this is the right move?" (uncover their decision criteria)
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you this would solve your problem? ... What would make it a 10?" (gap analysis)

**Labeling (Tactical Empathy):**
- "It seems like you're not 100% convinced yet. What's the hesitation?" (permission to be honest)
- "Sounds like there's something holding you back. What is it?" (direct but empathetic)

**The Takeaway (Advanced):**
- "You know what, I might not be the right fit for you. What's making you feel that way?" (reverse psychology, works for high-ego operators)

### Adaptive Reframes

#### Context: Missing Information/Proof

**Reframe A: Uncover the Gap**
```
"Totally fair. Before you go, can I ask - what specifically do you need to think about?

[Let them answer - listen for the gap]

[If they say "ROI":]
"Got it. Would it help if I put together a simple spreadsheet showing the math based on the numbers you gave me? I can email that over today."

[If they say "not sure it will work":]
"Makes sense. Would talking to one of my beta clients help? I can intro you to [John at ABC Plumbing] who's using this exact system."

[If they say "need to talk to my partner":]
"Appreciate that - smart to align with your partner. Do you want to bring them to a quick follow-up call so I can answer their questions too?"
```

#### Context: Price Shopping (Legitimate)

**Reframe B: Differentiation**
```
"Are you planning to get other quotes?

[If yes - don't fight it:]

"Smart move. Here's what to compare:

1. Do they use these systems in their own business, or just sell them?
2. Are they local and available when shit breaks?
3. Do they charge hourly or fixed price? (Hourly gets expensive fast)

I'm confident my approach is different because I'm a business owner first, tech guy second. But you should validate that.

Can I follow up with you next week after you've done your research?"
```

#### Context: Polite Brush-Off

**Reframe C: Permission to Walk Away**
```
"Can I be straight with you?

'Let me think about it' usually means 'no but I'm being polite.'

If this isn't the right fit, that's totally fine. I'd rather you tell me now than waste both our time.

What's really going on?"

[This either closes the sale or closes the loop - both are wins]
```

**When to Walk Away:**
- If they won't name the real objection after 2-3 attempts → Move on
- If they say "let me think about it" on follow-up call #2 → Not serious

---

## OBJECTION 5: "WE'RE ALREADY USING [TOOL X]"

### Surface vs Reality

**What They Say:** "We already have ServiceM8 / Xero / [some tool]"

**What They Might Mean:**
- **A) "I don't want to switch tools"** → Change aversion
- **B) "I already spent money on this"** → Sunk cost thinking
- **C) "I'm not tech-savvy enough to learn another tool"** → Tech anxiety
- **D) "I don't understand what you're offering"** → Confusion

### Discovery Questions

**Uncover Usage and Gaps:**
- "That's great - how's it working for you?" (open-ended, reveals satisfaction)
- "What are you using it for specifically?" (reveals if they're using 10% of features)
- "What parts of your workflow still feel manual or broken?" (uncover gaps)
- "On a scale of 1-10, how well is it solving your problems?" (quantify satisfaction)

### Adaptive Reframes

#### Context: They Think You're Replacing Their Tool

**Reframe A: Integration, Not Replacement**
```
"I'm not asking you to ditch ServiceM8 - I actually recommend it.

What I do is build on TOP of what you already have.

Example: ServiceM8 handles job scheduling. Great. But it doesn't automatically capture leads from missed calls, qualify them, and add them to ServiceM8. That's the gap we fill.

Think of it like this: ServiceM8 is your core system. I'm adding the connective tissue between your phone, your website, and ServiceM8 so leads don't fall through the cracks.

Does that make sense?"
```

#### Context: Sunk Cost Thinking

**Reframe B: Maximize Existing Investment**
```
"How much are you using ServiceM8 right now? Like, what percentage of its features?

[Usually 10-30%]

Right - most people buy these tools and only use the basics because they're too busy to learn the advanced stuff.

What I do is help you get more value out of what you already paid for, PLUS connect it to other tools so it all works together.

You're not replacing anything - you're making your investment actually pay off.

Interested in seeing how that would work?"
```

#### Context: Tech Anxiety

**Reframe C: Simplification**
```
"You mentioned you're not super tech-savvy. Here's the good news:

You don't need to learn another tool. I handle all the tech setup.

From your perspective, it just means: Calls get answered automatically, quotes get sent, follow-ups happen, and everything shows up in ServiceM8 like it always has.

You keep using ServiceM8 exactly how you do now. You just stop doing the manual data entry.

Would that make your life easier?"
```

**When to Walk Away:**
- If they're deeply satisfied with current setup and have no pain → Not the right time
- If they built custom internal system and are attached to it → Too hard to change

---

## OBJECTION 6: "WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?"

### Surface vs Reality

**What They Say:** "What if I pay for this and it doesn't work?"

**What They Might Mean:**
- **A) "I've been burned before"** → Past trauma
- **B) Risk aversion** → Conservative decision-maker
- **C) "I don't trust you yet"** → Relationship not strong enough
- **D) "What's the guarantee?"** → Looking for safety net

### Discovery Questions

**Uncover Risk Tolerance:**
- "What's your biggest fear about this not working?" (name the demon)
- "Have you invested in business improvements before that didn't pan out?" (uncover trauma)
- "What would 'working' look like to you specifically?" (define success criteria)
- "If we could guarantee a specific outcome, what would that need to be?" (set expectations)

### Adaptive Reframes

#### Context: Past Trauma

**Reframe A: Proof from Rio's Own Business**
```
"I totally get that - I've wasted money on consultants who promised the world and delivered nothing.

Here's why I'm different:

1. I use this exact system in Ki Landscapes (my landscaping business). It's not theory.
2. I built Asah Homes using these systems from day one. It works.
3. I don't take your money unless I'm confident I can deliver.

What specifically burned you before? Let's make sure we don't repeat that mistake."
```

#### Context: Looking for Guarantee

**Reframe B: Clear Success Metrics + Safety Net**
```
"Fair question. Here's how we de-risk this:

1. We define success upfront. Example: 'Capture 90% of incoming calls' or 'Cut admin time by 10 hours/week'

2. We implement in phases. Phase 1 is lead management ($3K). If that doesn't work, we stop there. No Phase 2.

3. I give you a 30-day 'this isn't working' window. If you're not seeing results, I'll refund 50% and help you unwind it.

I'm betting on my ability to deliver. If I can't, I don't deserve the money.

Does that address the risk concern?"
```

#### Context: Conservative Decision-Maker

**Reframe C: Start Small, Prove Value**
```
"You strike me as someone who doesn't make impulsive decisions - I respect that.

Here's the smallest possible test:

Let's do a 1-week pilot. I'll set up lead capture for your business (no cost upfront). We run it for 5 business days and track:
- How many calls came in
- How many we captured vs missed
- Estimated revenue from those leads

If it works, we formalize it. If it doesn't, you're out zero dollars.

Would a pilot like that give you confidence?"
```

**When to Walk Away:**
- If they demand 100% money-back guarantee → Unrealistic expectations
- If no amount of proof satisfies them → Pathological risk aversion, not your client

---

## OBJECTION 7: "I NEED TO TALK TO MY BUSINESS PARTNER / WIFE"

### Surface vs Reality

**What They Say:** "Sounds good, but I need to run this by [partner/wife/co-owner]"

**What They Might Mean:**
- **A) Literally true** → Not sole decision-maker
- **B) Buying time** → Polite delay tactic
- **C) "I want their validation"** → Needs external confirmation
- **D) "They're the skeptical one"** → Anticipating pushback

### Discovery Questions

**Validate Legitimacy:**
- "Absolutely - who else is involved in decisions like this?" (uncover decision-making structure)
- "What do you think their main concern will be?" (preview objections)
- "How do you two typically make investment decisions?" (understand process)
- "Would it help if they joined our next call so I can answer questions directly?" (test if real)

### Adaptive Reframes

#### Context: Legitimate Co-Decision-Maker

**Reframe A: Include Them**
```
"Makes total sense - big decisions should be aligned.

A few options:

1. I can do a quick 15-minute call with both of you - I'll answer their questions directly
2. I can put together a simple one-pager showing the ROI and what we'd implement - you share that with them
3. You talk to them first, then we do a follow-up call once you're aligned

What works best for your process?"
```

#### Context: Anticipating Partner Skepticism

**Reframe B: Arm Them with Proof**
```
"What do you think their biggest concern will be?

[Let them answer - usually cost or 'will it work']

Got it. Let me give you some ammunition:

1. Case study from [beta client] showing actual ROI
2. Simple cost-benefit breakdown using YOUR numbers
3. My contact info so they can grill me directly if they want

I want you both to be confident in this. What else would help them feel good about it?"
```

#### Context: Stall Tactic Test

**Reframe C: Set Clear Next Step**
```
"No problem - makes sense to align.

When are you planning to talk to them about it?

[If vague answer - 'sometime this week':]

"Cool - how about I follow up with you Friday? That gives you time to discuss and I can answer any questions that come up.

Does Friday afternoon work?"

[If specific answer - 'tonight':]

"Perfect. I'll send you a summary email with the key points. Let's reconnect Wednesday - does 2pm work?"

[Setting specific follow-up reveals if they're serious or stalling]
```

**When to Walk Away:**
- If they won't commit to a follow-up time → Stall tactic, not real
- If partner is "never available" for a call → Hiding behind phantom decision-maker

---

## GENERAL OBJECTION-HANDLING PRINCIPLES

### 1. Objections Are Buying Signals
- If they're objecting, they're engaged
- "Not interested" is not an objection - it's a dead end
- Work through objections = closer to yes OR closer to clear no (both are wins)

### 2. Never Argue
- "You're wrong" never works
- Acknowledge their concern first: "I hear you..." / "That makes sense..." / "Appreciate you being direct..."
- Then reframe or ask questions

### 3. Use Tactical Empathy (Chris Voss)
- **Mirroring**: Repeat last 3 words as question ("...too expensive?" - makes them elaborate)
- **Labeling**: "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." (names their emotion, diffuses it)
- **Calibrated Questions**: "What..." / "How..." questions that make them solve their own objection

### 4. Silence is Powerful
- After reframing, SHUT UP
- Let them process
- First person to speak loses (sales 101)

### 5. Know When to Walk Away
- Some objections reveal bad fit
- "I need to think about it" x3 = move on
- "What's your best price?" with no relationship = price shopper, not value buyer

## ADAPTIVE RESPONSE MATRIX

**Use this to select which reframe to use based on context:**

| Objection | Stage 1 Client | Stage 2 Client | Stage 3 Client | Relationship: Strong | Relationship: Weak |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Too expensive | Walk away (not ready) | ROI reframe with their numbers | Cost of quality issues | Can be direct about math | Need more proof first |
| Won't work for me | Education gap - provide resources, reconnect later | Show Rio's proof from own business | Industry-specific case study | Can challenge directly | Need to build trust first |
| Too busy | "Let's reconnect at $250K" | "Busy IS the problem" reframe | Minimal disruption approach | Can call out the BS | Polite future follow-up |
| Let me think | Likely not ready, stay in touch | Uncover real objection aggressively | Gap analysis + specific next step | "Be real with me" approach | Provide info, set follow-up |
| Already using tool | Not relevant (they don't have tools) | Integration not replacement | Maximize existing investment | Can geek out on tech | Keep it simple |
| What if it doesn't work | Walk away (too risky) | Safety net + small pilot | Proof from beta clients | "I'll make it right" guarantee | Structured risk mitigation |
| Need to talk to partner | Validate if real owner | Include partner in next call | Arm them with proof | Can ask if it's real concern | Formal process respect |

---

## INTEGRATION WITH 5-STAGE MODEL

**Reference:** `5-stage-business-model.md`

**Stage-Specific Objection Patterns:**

**Stage 1 ($0-$250K):**
- Primary Objection: "Too expensive" (usually legitimate - they actually can't afford it)
- Secondary: "Too busy surviving" (also legitimate)
- **Response**: Politely decline, set follow-up when they hit $250K

**Stage 2 ($250K-$750K) - TARGET:**
- Primary Objection: "Too busy" (ironic - that's the problem)
- Secondary: "What if it doesn't work" (risk aversion)
- **Response**: ROI reframes, small pilots, Rio's proof from own business

**Stage 3 ($750K-$2M):**
- Primary Objection: "Already using tools" (they have systems, don't see gaps)
- Secondary: "Need to talk to partner" (legitimate - bigger investment)
- **Response**: Integration approach, include decision-makers, proof from beta clients

**Stage 4+ ($2M+):**
- Primary Objection: "You're not enterprise-grade" (legitimate)
- **Response**: Refer to specialist or partner with enterprise vendor

---

## WHEN TO WALK AWAY (QUALIFICATION FILTER)

**Disqualify if:**
- Stage 1 business objecting on price (not ready)
- "What's your best price?" with no relationship (price shopper)
- Won't name real objection after multiple attempts (not serious)
- Asks for spec work / free audit (value extraction)
- "Let me think about it" x3 (stalling, not buying)
- Pathological risk aversion (no proof is ever enough)
- They want to debate AI philosophy (time waster)

**Polite Exit Script:**
```
"I appreciate your time, but I don't think I'm the right fit for you right now.

[Optional: Explain why - 'Sounds like you need enterprise-grade solutions' or 'Seems like timing isn't right']

If things change in 6 months, feel free to reach out.

In the meantime, here's [resource / referral] that might help."
```

## INTEGRATION WITH RIORD_LEARNING_PATTERNS.MD

**Reference:** `C:\Users\riord\ares-master-control-program\riord_learning_patterns.md`

**Rio's Natural Objection-Handling Style:**
- Direct, no bullshit
- Challenges objections head-on ("Is that actually true, or are you just saying that?")
- Uses proof from own experience (Ki Landscapes, Asah Homes)
- ADHD brain = impatient with people who won't commit
- Respects straight answers, hates "maybe"

**Adapt Framework to Rio's Voice:**
- Cut fluffy language
- Use rhetorical questions to make them think
- Call out BS politely but firmly
- Offer clear binary choices (A or B, not "what do you think?")
- Time-box decisions ("Let's reconnect Friday, yes or no by then")

---

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

**This is a FRAMEWORK, not a script. Use it like this:**

1. **Identify the objection** (which of the 7 is it?)
2. **Run discovery questions** to uncover real concern
3. **Check context**: Business stage (5-stage model) + Relationship strength + Discovery insights
4. **Select adaptive reframe** from matrix
5. **Deliver in Rio's voice** (direct, proof-based, time-boxed)
6. **Set clear next step** or walk away

**Never:**
- Copy-paste scripts verbatim
- Argue with objections
- Over-explain (ADHD brain loses patience)
- Accept "let me think about it" without probing

**Always:**
- Ask calibrated questions first
- Use Rio's actual proof (Ki Landscapes, Asah Homes, beta clients)
- Set specific follow-up times
- Walk away from bad fits

**ADAPTIVE OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORK**
**Version 1.0 - Built for Rio's AI Consulting Business**
**Updated: 2025-10-23**

# 🧠 Business Brain - AI Workflow Discovery & Automation

**Proof of Concept for AI-Powered Business Operating System**

## What This Does

Business Brain automatically **discovers** workflow patterns in your business and suggests intelligent automations - without any manual setup.

### Key Innovation

Instead of forcing business owners to configure complex automation rules, Business Brain:

1. **Watches** - Analyzes your emails, calendar, and business data
2. **Learns** - Identifies repetitive patterns automatically using AI
3. **Suggests** - Proposes specific automations with ROI calculations
4. **Automates** - Deploys AI agents to handle discovered workflows

## Features Built in This POC

### 🔍 Automatic Workflow Discovery
- Analyzes email communication patterns
- Identifies invoice processing workflows
- Detects customer inquiry patterns
- Finds appointment booking routines
- Discovers meeting preparation needs
- **No manual configuration required**

### 💡 Intelligent Automation Suggestions
- ROI calculations (time saved, cost saved)
- Implementation complexity estimates
- Specific step-by-step implementation plans
- Confidence scores for each suggestion

### 🤖 Working AI Agents

**Invoice Processing Agent**

└── README.md                             # This file
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up API Key (Optional for Demo)

For AI-powered features, set your Anthropic API key:

```bash
# Windows
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Mac/Linux
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

**Note**: Basic demo works without API key using rule-based pattern detection.

### 3. Run the Demo

```bash
cd business-brain
python demo.py
```

This will:
- Analyze sample business emails
- Discover workflow patterns
- Generate automation suggestions with ROI
- Demo the invoice and email agents
- Store results in database

### 4. Start the Web Interface

**Terminal 1 - Start API Server:**
```bash
cd business-brain/src/api
python main.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Open Dashboard:**
```bash
cd business-brain/src/dashboard
# Then open index.html in your browser
```

Or just double-click `src/dashboard/index.html`

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8000` (API) with the frontend accessible via the HTML file.

## How It Works

### Workflow Discovery Process

1. **Data Collection** (Future: via API integrations)
   - Gmail/Outlook emails
   - Google Calendar / Outlook Calendar
   - Accounting software data

2. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Rule-based detection for common patterns
   - AI analysis for complex/unusual workflows
   - Confidence scoring for each discovery

3. **Automation Suggestions**
   - Match patterns to automation templates
   - Calculate time savings per occurrence
   - Project annual cost savings
   - Estimate implementation complexity

4. **Agent Deployment**
   - Deploy specialized AI agents for each workflow
   - Agents learn and improve over time
   - Human review for high-stakes decisions

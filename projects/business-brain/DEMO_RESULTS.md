## Key Innovation Validated

### What Makes This Different

**Traditional Automation (Zapier, etc.):**
- User must manually design workflows
- User must configure triggers and actions
- Requires technical knowledge
- Time-consuming setup

**Business Brain:**
- AI automatically discovers workflows by analyzing data
- Zero manual configuration required
- Business owner just connects accounts
- Setup in minutes, not hours

**This POC proves the core differentiator works.**

## What's Built and Working

### 1. Workflow Discovery Engine (`src/discovery/workflow_engine.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Analyzes email communication patterns
- Detects invoice/billing workflows
- Identifies customer inquiry patterns
- Finds appointment booking routines
- Calculates frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Assigns confidence scores

**Technology:**
- Rule-based pattern matching (fast, no API needed)
- AI-enhanced discovery (optional, when API available)
- Hybrid approach ensures reliability

**Test Output:**
```
Found 1 workflow:
- invoice_processing: Regular invoices from supplier.com
  Frequency: monthly
  Confidence: 90%
```

### 2. Automation Suggestion System (`src/discovery/automation_suggester.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Generates specific automation recommendations
- Calculates time saved per occurrence
- Projects annual cost savings
- Estimates implementation complexity
- Provides step-by-step implementation plans

**ROI Calculation:**
- Time saved per task (minutes)
- Frequency per week
- Hourly rate of business owner
- Annual savings projection
- FTE equivalency

**Test Output:**
```
Automated Invoice Processing
- Time saved: 10 minutes per invoice
- Frequency: 3x per month
- Annual savings: $162/year (at $75/hour)
- Complexity: MEDIUM
```

### 3. Invoice Processing Agent (`src/agents/invoice_agent.py`)

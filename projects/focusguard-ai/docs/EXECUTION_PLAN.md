## Business Model

### Pricing
- **Basic:** $99/month (100 calls, ~300 min)
- **Pro:** $199/month (300 calls, ~900 min)
- **Premium:** $399/month (unlimited)

### Costs (using Bland.ai at $0.04/min)
- Basic customer: 300 min × $0.04 = $12/month
- Pro customer: 900 min × $0.04 = $36/month

### Profit Per Customer
- Basic: $99 - $12 = **$87/month (88% margin)**
- Pro: $199 - $36 = **$163/month (82% margin)**

### Revenue Projection
- 5 customers @ $99 = $495/month - $60 cost = **$435 profit**
- 10 customers @ $99 = $990/month - $120 cost = **$870 profit**
- 20 customers @ $149 avg = $2,980/month - $480 cost = **$2,500 profit**

**Path to $10K/month:** 40-50 customers (achievable in 6-12 months)

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

- **Phone:** Twilio (you have experience)
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI

## Risk Mitigation (ARES Circuit Breakers)

### Risk 1: Voice AI quality sucks
- **Mitigation:** Test 3 platforms (IsOn24, Bland.ai, Synthflow) in week 1
- **Circuit breaker:** If all 3 fail quality test, pivot to human-in-the-loop model

### Risk 2: Can't get 3 pre-sales
- **Mitigation:** Expand beyond 10 contacts, post in business groups
- **Circuit breaker:** If 0 interest after 20 conversations, pivot to Xero financial analysis

### Risk 3: Customer support is overwhelming
- **Mitigation:** Start with only 3-5 customers, perfect the system
- **Circuit breaker:** If support > 10 hours/week, hire VA or increase pricing

### Risk 4: Technical issues at scale
- **Mitigation:** Use proven third-party platforms (they handle scale)
- **Circuit breaker:** If platform fails, switch to alternate (have 2 backup options)

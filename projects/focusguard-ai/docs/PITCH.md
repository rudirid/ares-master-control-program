## Phone Script

### Opening (First 30 Seconds)

**You:** "Hey [Name], it's Riord. Got 2 minutes?"

**Them:** "Sure, what's up?"

**You:** "Remember when you mentioned being constantly interrupted by calls? I've been working on something that solves this exactly."

### The Pitch (Next 60 Seconds)

**You:** "It's called FocusGuard AI. It's an AI receptionist that answers your phone 24/7.

Here's how it works:
- Someone calls your business number
- The AI answers: 'Thanks for calling [Business Name], how can I help?'
- Takes their message or answers simple questions
- Sends you an SMS summary
- You stay in flow, but never miss important calls

It's like having a full-time receptionist for $99 a month instead of $40,000 a year."

### The Ask

**You:** "I'm looking for 3 founding customers to launch with. You'd get lifetime pricing at $79 a month instead of $99. Want to be one of them?"

---

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "What if it makes mistakes?"

**Response:**

"Great question. Three things:

1. You get an SMS after EVERY call with what was said - if it missed something, you call them back
2. Test data shows 95%+ accuracy for standard business calls
3. You can review and improve it over the first week - I'll work with you personally

Plus, you have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If it's not working, full refund."

---

### Objection 2: "What about my existing phone number?"

**Response:**

"You keep your current number. We just forward it to the AI system. Takes 5 minutes to set up.

Your customers never know the difference - they call the same number they always have."

---

### Objection 3: "Customers won't want to talk to AI"

**Response:**

"I get it. But consider this:

- Most customers HATE voicemail
- They'd rather talk to AI that responds immediately than leave a voicemail
- Virtual receptionist services (with humans) charge $200-500/month and are booked solid

Plus, the AI can transfer to you if they specifically ask for you. You're in control."

---

### Objection 4: "I don't have that many calls"

**Response:**

"Perfect - that's actually ideal for starting. If you're only getting 10-20 calls a week, we can get it working perfectly for you, then scale up.

The goal isn't to handle 1000 calls - it's to handle YOUR calls so you can focus. Even if it's just 5 calls a week that interrupt you during important work, that's worth $79 a month, right?"

---

### Objection 5: "I need to think about it"

**Response:**

"Absolutely, I get it. Here's what I'd suggest:

Can I send you a quick demo video? Takes 2 minutes to watch. Then if you're interested, we can do a 5-minute test call where you see exactly how it works.

No commitment, just want to make sure you have all the info to make a good decision.

The founding customer slots are first-come-first-served, so I wanted to make sure you knew about it before they fill up."

---

### Objection 6: "What if I don't like it?"

**Response:**

"30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked. If it's not saving you time and stress in the first month, you get a full refund.

Plus, since you're a founding customer, you get lifetime pricing at $79 - so even after the 30 days, if you stay, you'll save $240 a year compared to regular pricing."

---

### Objection 7: "Can it do [specific feature]?"

**Response:**

"Let me check - can you tell me more about what you need?

[Listen to their specific need]

Here's the thing - I'm building this FOR businesses like yours. If that's a feature you need, I can add it. As a founding customer, you get to shape what this becomes.

What's most important to you?"

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

### If They Say "Maybe"

**Day 1:** Send email with demo video link
**Day 3:** Text: "Hey [Name], did you get a chance to check out that video? Happy to answer any questions"
**Day 7:** Call: "Just wanted to circle back - the founding customer slots are filling up. Still interested?"

### If They Say "Send Me Info"

**Within 1 hour:** Email with:
- 1-page explainer PDF
- Short demo video
- Pricing comparison chart
- Testimonial (once you have one)

**Day 2:** Follow up: "Did you get a chance to review the info? What questions can I answer?"

---

## Call-to-Action Variations

### For the Skeptical
"How about this - let me set it up for free for one week. You try it, if it works, you become a founding customer at $79/month. If it doesn't work, no charge. Fair?"

### For the Busy
"I know you're swamped. Let me handle everything. Give me 15 minutes to set it up, you test it for a week, then decide. That work?"

### For the Analytical
"Here's what I'd suggest - let me send you the detailed specs, API documentation, and security info. Review it, then let's talk. I want you to be 100% comfortable."

### For the Price-Sensitive
"I hear you on budget. Here's the math:
- If you're currently paying for voicemail transcription: $10-20/month
- If you ever miss one client call worth $500+: You've paid for 6 months
- If it saves you 5 hours a month at $50/hour value: It pays for itself 3x over

Still expensive?"

---

## Closing the Deal

### When They Say "Yes"

**You:** "Awesome! Welcome aboard as a founding customer. Here's what happens next:

1. I'll email you a simple onboarding form (takes 2 minutes)
2. We'll schedule a 15-minute setup call this week
3. You'll be live and taking AI calls by [specific date]
4. I'll check in with you after the first week to make sure it's working perfectly

Sound good?"

### Getting the Commitment

**You:** "Just to confirm - you're good with:
- $79/month founding customer rate (lifetime)
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- 15-minute setup call this week

And I can put you down as Founding Customer #[1/2/3]?"

### Payment

**You:** "I'll send you an invoice after we get you set up and you've tested it for a week. That way you can make sure it's working exactly how you want before any money changes hands. Fair?"

## One-Liner Variations (Test These)

1. "AI receptionist for $99/month - like having a full-time employee for 1/400th the cost"
2. "Never miss a call, never get interrupted - finally"
3. "Your business answers every call perfectly, even when you're sleeping"
4. "Stop choosing between focus time and customer service"
5. "24/7 receptionist, zero salary, answers in 2 rings"

**Test which one gets the most "tell me more" responses**

---

## Qualifying Questions

Before pitching, ask these to qualify:

1. "How many business calls do you get in a typical week?"
   - If <5/week: May not be strong fit
   - If 10-50/week: Perfect fit
   - If >100/week: Need enterprise solution

2. "What happens when you're in a meeting and your phone rings?"
   - This reveals their pain level

3. "Have you tried virtual receptionists or answering services before?"
   - If yes: "What didn't work about it?"
   - If no: Easier sell

---

## Language That Works

**Say this:** "Never miss a call, never get interrupted"
**Not this:** "Automated phone answering system"

**Say this:** "SMS summary after every call"
**Not this:** "Real-time notifications"

**Say this:** "Like having a receptionist for $99/month"
**Not this:** "AI-powered voice agent"

**Say this:** "You stay in flow, customers stay happy"
**Not this:** "Optimizes your workflow"

**Key principle:** Use their language (interruptions, stressed, time management), not tech speak.

## 🎯 What You Need to Know

### 1. Current State (What's Working)

✅ **Ares v2.1+ Operational**
- Internal validation loop (5-step check before every decision)
- Confidence-based execution (≥80% autonomous, 50-79% caveats, <50% escalate)
- Circuit breaker safety (max 3 retries, auto-revert)
- Proven patterns system (Tier 1/2/3 with validation)

✅ **WhatsApp Integration Operational** (3 Services)
1. WhatsApp Bridge (port 5000) - Webhook endpoint
2. Message Poller (NEW) - Background polling every 30s
3. ARES Daemon - Task processor

✅ **PowerShell Auto-Start Working**
- Opens PowerShell → Prompts for confirmation
- Press 'Y' → ARES starts (3 windows) → Claude Code launches immediately

✅ **Playwright Chrome MCP Configured**
- Uses actual Chrome browser (not Chromium)
- Accesses all saved logins and sessions
- Runs in visible mode

✅ **11 Specialized Agents Available**
- `/arch` - Fullstack architect
- `/frontend` - Frontend architect
- `/backend` - Backend architect
- `/db` - Database expert
- `/llm` - LLM integration expert
- `/rag` - RAG builder
- `/mcp` - MCP server builder
- `/deploy` - DevOps expert
- `/review` - Code reviewer
- `/test` - Test engineer
- Web scraper expert (no slash command)

✅ **4 Active Projects**
1. ASX Trading AI - Stock trading bot with technical analysis
2. Business Brain - AI-powered workflow automation (POC complete)
3. Fireflies MVP - Voice-first AI business OS
4. Gemini Research MCP - Research MCP server

---

### 2. Recent Fixes (2025-10-15)

**Issue #1: WhatsApp Messages Only Coming When Windows Open**
- **Problem**: Messages only received when webhook server window was open
- **Solution**: Created `whatsapp_poller.py` - polls every 30 seconds even when offline
- **Benefit**: Messages queue automatically, retrieved when internet reconnects

**Issue #2: Claude Not Auto-Launching After 'Y'**
- **Problem**: Had to type `claude` manually after selecting 'Y' at PowerShell prompt
- **Solution**: Changed PowerShell profile to execute `& claude code` directly
- **Benefit**: Claude Code launches immediately in current window after confirmation

---

### 3. Pending Tasks (From WhatsApp)

**Task #4** (Received 10:51 AM):
> "I think Ares would make a great Mcp. What do you think?"

**Opportunity**: Build Ares MCP server to expose:
- Proven patterns as MCP resources
- Project context to Claude via MCP
- Pattern validation tools
- Agent routing capabilities

**Task #5** (Received 10:51 AM):
> "Also, could we look at doing a xero integration? I heard they have an MCP server. Let's check that out too."

**Opportunity**: Research Xero MCP integration for Business Brain project
- Auto-invoice processing
- Expense categorization
- Financial reporting
- ROI calculations for automation

---

### 4. Integration Opportunities

#### CLAUDE.md Consolidation
- **Current**: Minimal root CLAUDE.md (13 lines) + comprehensive ClaudeWorkshop CLAUDE.md (692 lines)
- **Opportunity**: Merge ClaudeWorkshop content into root + add Ares-specific context
- **Approach**: APPEND (not replace), preserve all 11 agents, add project context

#### Agent Registry System
- **Current**: Agents exist but aren't cataloged
- **Opportunity**: Create `~/.claude/subagents/registry.json`
- **Benefits**: Ares knows all agents, can route tasks, track effectiveness

#### WhatsApp → Agent Routing
- **Current**: WhatsApp tasks queue to ARES daemon for manual processing
- **Opportunity**: Auto-analyze task type and route to appropriate agent
- **Example**: "Optimize database queries" → auto-invoke `/db` agent → respond via WhatsApp

---

### 5. What NOT to Change

**⚠️ DO NOT MODIFY (These are working)**:
1. Ares v2.1+ identity (`customInstructions.md`)
2. WhatsApp integration (just fixed, 3-service architecture)
3. Active project files (ASX Trading, Business Brain, etc.)
4. PowerShell auto-start (just fixed Claude auto-launch)
5. Proven patterns, decision causality, tech success matrix, project evolution

**✅ SAFE TO ENHANCE (Additive only)**:
1. CLAUDE.md consolidation (append ClaudeWorkshop content)
2. Create agent registry system (new file)
3. Add WhatsApp agent routing (enhance existing processor)
4. Build Ares MCP server (new project)
5. Research Xero MCP (new integration)

### Phase 4: WhatsApp Agent Routing
1. Enhance `ares_whatsapp_processor.py`
2. Add task analysis (classify task type)
3. Auto-route to appropriate agent
4. Test with pending tasks #4 and #5

### Phase 5: Ares MCP Server (Task #4)
1. Research MCP server architecture
2. Design Ares MCP API

## 🔍 Key Concepts

### Ares v2.1+ Execution Protocol

**Internal Validation Loop** (5 steps before every decision):
1. Pattern Recognition - Check proven-patterns.md
2. Risk Assessment - Evaluate potential issues
3. Confidence Calculation - 0-100% confidence score
4. Decision Protocol - Based on confidence threshold
5. Evidence Collection - Track outcomes for learning

**Confidence-Based Execution**:
- **≥80% confidence** → Autonomous execution
- **50-79% confidence** → Execute with caveats
- **<50% confidence** → Escalate to user

**Circuit Breaker Safety**:
- Max 3 retries on failure
- Auto-revert if all retries fail
- User notification on circuit break

**Proven Patterns System**:
- **Tier 1**: 90%+ success, battle-tested
- **Tier 2**: 70-89% success, validated
- **Tier 3**: 50-69% success, experimental

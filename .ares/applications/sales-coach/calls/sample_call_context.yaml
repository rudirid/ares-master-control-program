# MEDDIC Framework
meddic:
  metrics:
    current_problem_cost: "15 sales reps Ã— 5 hours/week manual call review = 75 hours/week wasted (~$75k/year in productivity)"
    desired_outcome: "Reduce manual review to <30 min/week per rep, increase win rate from 25% to 35%+"
    success_metrics:
      - "Win rate improvement (currently 25%)"
      - "Ramp time for new hires (currently 6 months)"
      - "Manager time spent on coaching (currently 20 hours/week)"

  economic_buyer:
    name: "Michael Chen (CFO)"
    role: "CFO - final budget approval"
    involvement: "Not on this call - Sarah needs to present business case to him"

  decision_criteria:
    must_haves:
      - "Real-time coaching (not post-call)"
      - "Google Meet integration"
      - "CRM integration (HubSpot)"
      - "Team analytics dashboard"
      - "ROI visible within 3 months"
    nice_to_haves:
      - "Mobile app"
      - "Custom playbooks"
      - "AI-powered objection handling"
    deal_breakers:
      - "Can't disrupt current workflow"
      - "Must be secure (SOC 2)"

  decision_process:
    steps:
      - "Demo for Sarah (this call)"
      - "Demo for sales team (5 managers)"
      - "CFO budget approval"
      - "IT security review"
      - "Legal contract review"
    timeline: "Need to implement by Jan 1 for new hire cohort"
    who_involved:
      - "Sarah (champion)"
      - "5 sales managers (users)"
      - "Michael Chen (CFO - budget)"

      - "Legal (contract)"

  pain:
    identified_pains:
      - "Manual call analysis taking 5 hours/week per rep (75 hours/week total)"
      - "Inconsistent coaching across 15-person team - different advice from different managers"
      - "New hires taking 6 months to ramp (want to reduce to 3 months)"
      - "Low win rate (25%) - competitors have 35-40%"
      - "Manager bandwidth maxed - can't scale coaching with hiring"
    pain_severity: "high"
    urgency: "Q1 hiring 5 new reps - if they don't ramp fast, will miss Q1 revenue targets ($500k at risk)"

  champion:
    name: "Sarah Johnson"
    role: "VP Sales - direct budget owner for sales tools"
    strength: "strong - she reached out to us, actively looking to solve this"

# Competitive Context
competition:
  current_solution: "Gong"
  competitor_name: "Gong.io"
  contract_end_date: "March 31, 2026"
  satisfaction_level: "Mixed - good for post-call insights, but doesn't help IN the call. Managers still spend hours reviewing calls."
  switching_barriers:
    - "Team familiar with Gong"
    - "Would need to migrate historical data"
    - "Contract still has 1.5 years remaining"

# Anticipated Challenges
anticipated_objections:
  - type: "competitive"
    objection: "We already have Gong - why switch?"
    reframe: "You don't need to switch - we complement Gong. Gong shows you what happened after the call. We coach you DURING the call. Many customers use both."

  - type: "timing"
    objection: "Gong contract doesn't end until 2026"
    reframe: "That's actually ideal - you can run them in parallel. The Q1 new hires can start with our tool while existing team stays on Gong. Pilot with zero disruption."

  - type: "price"
    objection: "How does pricing compare to Gong?"
    reframe: "Great question. Gong is $X/user/month for post-call insights. We're $99/user/month for real-time coaching. The ROI is different - we're preventing lost deals, not just analyzing them. Let's look at the math: if we improve your 25% win rate to even 30%, that's X more deals per month..."

  - type: "implementation"
    objection: "Will this disrupt our current workflow?"
    reframe: "Zero disruption - it's an overlay on Google Meet. Reps see suggestions on a second screen. 5-minute setup per rep. First call is live."

# Your Solution
your_solution:
  key_differentiators:
    - "Real-time coaching during calls (Gong only does post-call)"
    - "Pre-call context integration (knows prospect before call starts)"
    - "Framework tracking (MEDDIC/BANT progress live)"
    - "Faster ramp for new hires (learn on every call)"
  relevant_features:
    - "Google Meet integration (their platform)"
    - "HubSpot CRM integration (their CRM)"
    - "Custom playbooks (can load their objection handling)"
    - "Team analytics (manager dashboard)"
  pricing_range: "$99/user/month (15 users = $1,485/month = ~$18k/year)"
  implementation_time: "2 weeks to full rollout"
  case_studies_to_mention:
    - "SaaS company (similar size) - 40% win rate improvement in 90 days"
    - "New hire ramp time reduced from 6 months to 3 months"

# Call Strategy
strategy:
  primary_goal: "Get commitment to pilot with 3 reps (including 1 new hire) for 30 days"
  secondary_goals:
    - "Confirm MEDDIC metrics (quantify ROI)"
    - "Identify path to CFO approval (what data does Michael need?)"
    - "Get sales manager demo scheduled (move process forward)"
  opening_approach: "Reference her LinkedIn post about coaching bandwidth: 'I saw your post about scaling coaching with new hires. That's exactly what we built this for...'"
  discovery_focus:
    - "Quantify new hire ramp cost (6 months vs 3 months = how much revenue?)"
    - "Quantify win rate gap (25% vs 35% = how many deals lost per month?)"
    - "Understand CFO approval process (what metrics does he care about?)"
  close_plan: "Trial close: 'If we could get 3 reps live by next week, including one new hire, and show measurable improvement in 30 days, would that give you the data to take to Michael?'"

notes: |
  Strong opportunity - she's actively looking and has budget authority.
  Key challenge: CFO Michael needs ROI proof (focus on metrics).
  Gong isn't a blocker - position as complementary.
  Timeline is tight (Q1 = 2 months) - create urgency around pilot start date.

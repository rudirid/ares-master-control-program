- Generates suggestions (pattern matching + Claude)
- Broadcasts to extension
- Health check endpoint

**Usage**:

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow

```
[User speaks in Google Meet]
        ↓
[Web Speech API] ← Chrome built-in (free)
        ↓ (~500ms)
[content.js] ← Captures transcript
        ↓
[background.js] ← Service worker
        ↓ (WebSocket to localhost:5001)
[extension_server.py] ← Python backend
        ↓
[RealtimeCoach] ← Loads context, generates suggestions
   ├→ PatternMatcher ← <100ms (instant)
   └→ Claude API ← ~1s (optional)
        ↓
[WebSocket response]
        ↓
[background.js] ← Receives suggestion
        ↓
[content.js] ← Displays in overlay
        ↓
[User sees suggestion in Meet]
```

**Total Latency**: 600ms (pattern only) to 2s (with Claude)
**Target**: <3 seconds ✅

## Technical Decisions Made

### Web Speech API vs Deepgram

**Decision**: Web Speech API
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ $0 cost (vs $0.13/call)
- ✅ No API setup required
- ✅ Built into Chrome (where Meet runs)
- ✅ ~500ms latency (comparable to Deepgram)
- ❌ Requires internet (but Meet already does)
- ❌ Chrome-only (acceptable - target audience uses Chrome for Meet)

### Chrome Extension vs Browser Script

**Decision**: Chrome Extension
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ No manual activation (auto-loads on Meet)
- ✅ Persistent across page refreshes
- ✅ Professional UI (popup, badges)
- ✅ Background processing
- ❌ Requires installation (but one-time)
- ❌ More complex to build (but we did it)

### Injected Overlay vs Separate Tab

**Decision**: Injected Overlay
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ Single screen (no alt-tabbing)
- ✅ Always visible during call
- ✅ Integrated experience
- ❌ Takes screen space (but collapsible)

### Pattern Matching + Claude vs Claude Only

**Decision**: Hybrid Approach
**Reasoning**:
- ✅ Instant suggestions (pattern matching)
- ✅ Strategic depth (Claude when needed)
- ✅ Cost optimization (pattern is free)
- ✅ Redundancy (works if Claude fails)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Chrome Only**: Web Speech API not available in Firefox/Safari
   - **Impact**: Target audience uses Chrome for Meet (acceptable)
   - **Mitigation**: Could add Whisper fallback later

2. **Requires Internet**: Web Speech uses Google servers
   - **Impact**: Won't work offline
   - **Mitigation**: Same as Google Meet (also requires internet)

3. **No Speaker Diarization**: Can't distinguish you vs prospect
   - **Impact**: Assumes all speech is prospect
   - **Mitigation**: You speak rarely, mostly listening (acceptable for now)

4. **English Only**: Web Speech configured for en-US
   - **Impact**: Won't work for other languages
   - **Mitigation**: Easy to change in code (one line)

5. **Meet Only**: Currently only Google Meet
   - **Impact**: No Zoom/Teams support yet
   - **Mitigation**: Planned for v1.2

## ARES Integration

### Standalone Application

The extension runs as an ARES-managed application:

```bash
# Via ARES
python ares_app_manager.py start sales-coach-extension

# Or standalone
python extension_server.py
```

### Agent Orchestration (Optional)

Enable ARES agent routing for complex questions:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key"
python extension_server.py
```

- Simple objections → Pattern matching (instant)
- Complex strategy → ARES agent routing (2s)

## Ready to Test!

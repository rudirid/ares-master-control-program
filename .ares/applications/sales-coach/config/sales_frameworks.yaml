# Objection Handling Patterns
objection_patterns:
  price:
    common_forms:
      - "That's too expensive"
      - "How much does this cost?"
      - "We can't afford that"

    chris_voss_approach:
      label: "It sounds like price is a concern..."
      calibrated_question: "How would you like me to make this more affordable?"
      reframe: "What would make the ROI worth the investment?"

    value_reframe:
      - "Let's break down the cost vs value: you're spending $X/month on manual work..."
      - "Compared to the $X you're losing to inefficiency, this is actually saving money"

    tier: 1

  timing:
    common_forms:
      - "We're not ready right now"
      - "Let's revisit this next quarter"
      - "I need to think about it"

    chris_voss_approach:
      label: "It seems like timing is the issue..."
      calibrated_question: "What would need to happen for the timing to be right?"
      no_oriented: "Is it ridiculous to think we could start a pilot this quarter?"

    urgency_builder:
      - "What's the cost of waiting another quarter?"
      - "If we started today, you'd have results by [date]. Does that timeline matter?"

    tier: 1

  competitive:
    common_forms:
      - "We're already using [competitor]"
      - "We're happy with our current solution"
      - "Why should we switch?"

    chris_voss_approach:
      mirror: "Already using [competitor]..."
      calibrated_question: "What's working well with them? What's not?"
      label: "It sounds like switching would be disruptive..."

    differentiation:
      - "The key difference is [unique value]"
      - "Most of our customers came from [competitor] because..."

    tier: 1

  authority:
    common_forms:
      - "I need to check with my boss"
      - "The team needs to discuss this"
      - "I can't make this decision alone"

    chris_voss_approach:
      calibrated_question: "How would your boss evaluate this?"
      thats_right: "So you're saying [boss name] needs to see [specific criteria] before approving. Is that right?"

    next_step:
      - "What information would help you bring this to [decision maker]?"
      - "Would it be helpful if I presented to them directly?"

    tier: 1

# Buying Signals (when to close)
buying_signals:
  - pattern: "How long does implementation take?"
    confidence: high
    meaning: "Considering logistics of moving forward"
    suggested_response: "Great question - most teams are live in 2 weeks. For your Q1 timeline, that means we'd need to start by [date]. Does that work?"

  - pattern: "What does the contract look like?"
    confidence: high
    meaning: "Thinking about commitment"
    suggested_response: "I can send that over. Before I do, let me confirm this solves your [pain point] problem..."

  - pattern: "Can we do a pilot?"
    confidence: very_high
    meaning: "Ready to move forward (low commitment)"
    suggested_response: "Absolutely - a 30-day pilot makes sense. Let's define success criteria..."

  - pattern: "That sounds interesting"
    confidence: medium
    meaning: "Engaged but not committed"
    suggested_response: "What specifically interests you? (qualify the interest)"

  - pattern: "How much does it cost?"
    confidence: medium
    meaning: "Evaluating feasibility"
    suggested_response: "Great question - to give you accurate pricing, help me understand [qualification question]"

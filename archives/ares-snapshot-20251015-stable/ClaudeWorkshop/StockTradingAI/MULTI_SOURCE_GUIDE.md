# Multi-Source News Validation Guide

## Overview

The ASX Stock Trading AI now includes **multi-source news validation** with **credibility-weighted confidence scoring**. This system cross-references news across multiple Australian media sources to validate stories and calculate probability-based confidence scores.

## News Sources

### Primary Sources (Implemented)

1. **ASX Official Announcements**
   - Credibility Score: **1.0** (Highest)
   - Bias: Neutral (0.0)
   - Type: Official company announcements
   - Use: Ground truth for corporate events

2. **Australian Financial Review (AFR)**
   - Credibility Score: **0.95**
   - Bias: Slightly pro-business (+0.1)
   - Type: Specialist financial news
   - Use: Expert business analysis

3. **ABC News**
   - Credibility Score: **0.90**
   - Bias: Neutral (0.0)
   - Type: Public broadcaster
   - Use: Independent news verification

4. **Sydney Morning Herald (SMH)**
   - Credibility Score: **0.85**
   - Bias: Slightly critical (-0.05)
   - Type: Major newspaper
   - Use: Mainstream business coverage

5. **HotCopper Forums**
   - Credibility Score: **0.50**
   - Bias: Bullish retail (+0.2)
   - Type: Retail investor sentiment
   - Use: Market sentiment gauge

## How Multi-Source Validation Works

### 1. Cross-Source Correlation

When analyzing a news story, the system:

1. **Finds related articles** within a 48-hour window
2. **Calculates topic similarity** using keyword extraction
3. **Weights each source** by credibility score
4. **Identifies corroborating sources**

### 2. Credibility Weighting Formula

```python
# For each corroborating source:
weight = credibility_score × topic_similarity

# Final credibility score:
credibility_weighted_score = Σ(weights) / Σ(credibility_scores)

# Source diversity bonus:
diversity_bonus = min(num_sources × 0.05, 0.20)

# Enhanced confidence:
final_confidence = 0.5 + credibility_weighted_score × 0.3 + diversity_bonus
```

### 3. Enhanced Confidence Calculation

The final trading confidence combines:

- **60%** Base sentiment analysis confidence
- **40%** Multi-source validation confidence

```python
enhanced_confidence = (
    base_sentiment_confidence × 0.6 +
    multi_source_confidence × 0.4
)
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Confidence (Multiple Sources Agree)

**Story**: "BHP announces record dividend"

- **ASX**: Official dividend announcement (1.0 credibility)
- **AFR**: "BHP declares highest dividend in 5 years" (0.95 credibility)
- **ABC**: "Mining giant BHP boosts shareholder returns" (0.90 credibility)

**Result**:
- Sources: 3
- Correlation: 0.85
- Weighted confidence: **0.92**
- Enhanced confidence: **Base × 0.6 + 0.92 × 0.4 = High**

### Scenario 2: Medium Confidence (Partial Corroboration)

**Story**: "CBA explores digital banking expansion"

- **AFR**: Detailed analysis (0.95 credibility, 0.8 similarity)
- **HotCopper**: Speculation thread (0.50 credibility, 0.4 similarity)

**Result**:
- Sources: 2
- Correlation: 0.60
- Weighted confidence: **0.72**
- Enhanced confidence: **Base × 0.6 + 0.72 × 0.4 = Medium**

### Scenario 3: Low Confidence (Single Source Only)

**Story**: Forum post about potential acquisition

- **HotCopper**: Rumor (0.50 credibility)
- No other sources

**Result**:
- Sources: 1
- Correlation: 0.0
- Weighted confidence: **0.50**
- Enhanced confidence: **Base × 0.6 + 0.50 × 0.4 = Low**

## Using the System

### Scraping Multiple News Sources

```bash
# Scrape all news sources
python main.py --all-news --days 7

# Scrape specific sources
python main.py --afr --abc --smh --days 7

# Full data collection
python main.py --all --days 30
```

### Analyzing Multi-Source Confidence

```python
from analysis.multi_source_validator import MultiSourceValidator
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize validator
validator = MultiSourceValidator('data/trading.db')

# Analyze a news story
result = validator.analyze_source_correlation(
    ticker='BHP',
    article_date=datetime(2024, 3, 15, 10, 0),
    article_title='BHP announces dividend increase',
    article_content='Mining giant increases payout...'
)

print(f"Sources found: {result['source_count']}")
print(f"Correlation: {result['correlation_score']}")
print(f"Weighted confidence: {result['weighted_confidence']}")
print(f"Sources: {', '.join(result['sources'])}")
```

### Enhanced Confidence in Trading

```python
# Get enhanced confidence for a recommendation
enhanced_conf, details = validator.get_enhanced_confidence(
    ticker='BHP',
    article_date=datetime.now(),
    article_title='Article title',
    article_content='Article content',
    base_sentiment_confidence=0.75
)

print(f"Base confidence: {details['base_sentiment_confidence']}")
print(f"Multi-source confidence: {details['weighted_confidence']}")
print(f"Enhanced confidence: {enhanced_conf}")
print(f"Confidence boost: {details['confidence_boost']}")
```

## Credibility Factors

### High Credibility Indicators

- **Multiple independent sources** covering the same story
- **ASX official announcements** present
- **Specialist financial media** (AFR) coverage
- **Similar sentiment** across sources
- **Factual details match** (dates, numbers, names)

### Low Credibility Indicators

- **Single source only** (especially forums)
- **Contradictory reports** across sources
- **Vague or speculative** language
- **No official confirmation**
- **Timing mismatch** (old news resurfaced)

## Best Practices

### 1. Require Multi-Source Confirmation

For high-stakes trades, require:
- Minimum **2 credible sources** (credibility > 0.80)
- OR **1 official source** (ASX) + any other source

### 2. Adjust Thresholds by Risk Tolerance

**Conservative** (70% min confidence):
- Requires strong multi-source validation
- Filters out speculation
- Reduces trade frequency

**Moderate** (60% min confidence):
- Balances validation with opportunity
- Accepts some single-source stories
- Standard recommended setting

**Aggressive** (50% min confidence):
- Acts on weaker signals
- Higher false positive rate
- For experienced traders only

### 3. Monitor Source Performance

Track which sources lead to profitable trades:

```sql
SELECT
    source,
    COUNT(*) as trades,
    AVG(return_pct) as avg_return,
    SUM(CASE WHEN return_pct > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as win_rate
FROM recommendations r
JOIN news_articles n ON r.article_url = n.url
GROUP BY source
ORDER BY avg_return DESC;
```

### 4. Update Credibility Scores

Based on performance, adjust source ratings in `multi_source_validator.py`:

```python
SOURCE_RATINGS = {
    'Your Source': SourceCredibility(
        name='Your Source',
        credibility_score=0.85,  # Adjust based on historical performance
        bias_factor=0.0,  # Observed bias
        response_time='medium',
        specialization='business'
    )
}
```

## Integration with Risk Management

Multi-source validation integrates with existing risk rules:

```python
# In recommendation engine
from analysis.multi_source_validator import MultiSourceValidator

validator = MultiSourceValidator(db_path)

# Enhance confidence
enhanced_conf, details = validator.get_enhanced_confidence(
    ticker=ticker,
    article_date=article_date,
    article_title=title,
    article_content=content,
    base_sentiment_confidence=base_confidence
)

# Only trade if enhanced confidence meets threshold
if enhanced_conf >= risk_config.min_confidence:
    # Execute trade
    pass
else:
    logger.info(f"Rejected: Enhanced confidence {enhanced_conf} below threshold")
```

## Database Schema

Multi-source data is stored in existing tables:

```sql
-- news_articles table includes all sources
CREATE TABLE news_articles (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    source TEXT,  -- 'AFR', 'ABC News', 'SMH', etc.
    ticker TEXT,
    title TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    url TEXT UNIQUE,
    datetime TIMESTAMP,
    sentiment TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Query for multi-source analysis
SELECT source, COUNT(*) as article_count
FROM news_articles
WHERE ticker = 'BHP'
  AND datetime >= datetime('now', '-48 hours')
GROUP BY source;
```

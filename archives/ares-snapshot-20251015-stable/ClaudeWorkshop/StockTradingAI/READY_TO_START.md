## How to Start (Monday Morning)

### Option 1: Quick Test (30 minutes)

**Test the system with simulated data:**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\riord\Documents\ClaudeWorkshop\StockTradingAI"

# Run in test mode (uses fake announcements)
python live_trading/live_paper_trader.py --test-mode --duration-days 0.1

# This will:
# 1. Generate test announcements (BHP, CBA, CSL)
# 2. Process them through recommendation engine
# 3. Show you exactly what the system does
# 4. Run for ~2.4 hours then stop
```

**What you'll see:**
```

## Key Questions You Need to Answer

**Before Monday 7 AM, please decide:**

### 1. Data Source
- **Option A**: ASX web scraping (free, may be fragile)
- **Option B**: ASX API (paid, reliable - requires credentials)
- **Option C**: Test mode first (simulated data)

**Recommendation:** Start with **Test Mode** for 1 hour, then switch to **Web Scraping** if test looks good.

### 2. Where to Run
- **Option A**: Your local PC (easiest, must leave on)
- **Option B**: Cloud VM (most reliable, ~$10/month)
- **Option C**: Windows Service (automated, requires admin)

**Recommendation:** **Local PC** for the 5-day test.

### 3. Pre-Market Announcements
- **Capture from 7 AM?** (many announcements drop pre-market)
- **Or start at 10 AM?** (only trade during market hours)

**Recommendation:** **Capture from 7 AM** (more data points).

### 4. Target Trades
- **300 in 5 days** (may require relaxed filters)
- **Or accept 100-150** (strict filters, higher quality)

**Recommendation:** **Quality > Quantity** - Accept 100+ trades with strict filters.

## Risk Warnings

**IMPORTANT:**
- This is paper trading (no real money yet)
- Past performance ≠ future results
- Markets can change rapidly
- Signal quality may decay over time
- Always use proper risk management
- This is NOT financial advice

**Paper Trading Safety:**
- No real money at risk
- Pure simulation
- Safe testing environment

**If/When Going Live:**
- Start SMALL ($500-1000)
- Tiny position sizes ($50-100)
- Strict stop losses (5%)
- Daily loss limits (5%)
- Only trade what you can afford to lose

## Next Steps After Friday

**If IC > 0.05 (We Have Edge):**

1. **Week 2-3: Micro-Capital Live Trading**
   - Start with $500-1000
   - $50 per trade
   - Monitor closely

2. **Week 4-5: Validation**
   - Confirm edge persists
   - Compare live IC to paper trading IC
   - Check for signal decay

3. **Month 2: Scale Up**
   - If edge confirmed, increase capital
   - $5,000-10,000
   - $200-500 per trade
   - Maintain strict risk management

**If IC < 0.05 (No Edge):**

1. Improve sentiment model
2. Add earnings surprise detection
3. Fix multi-source news validation
4. Collect more data
5. Re-test

# Live Paper Trading System - Setup Guide

**Target**: Collect 300 trade recommendations from Monday October 13 - Friday October 17, 2025

**Status**: ‚úÖ Infrastructure ready, awaiting data source configuration

---

## System Overview

### What We Built

**3 Core Components**:

1. **Live Announcement Monitor** (`live_trading/announcement_monitor.py`)
   - Monitors ASX for real-time announcements
   - Stores in `live_announcements` table
   - Tracks age, price-sensitive flag
   - Runs continuously during market hours

2. **Live Recommendation Engine** (`live_trading/live_recommendation_engine.py`)
   - Processes announcements in REAL-TIME
   - Applies ALL filters (TIME, TIME-OF-DAY, MATERIALITY, TECHNICAL, CONTRARIAN)
   - Gets current market price via yfinance
   - Generates BUY/SELL recommendations
   - Stores in `live_recommendations` table

3. **Self-Improvement Analysis** (`analysis/performance_attribution.py`)
   - Calculates Information Coefficient (IC)
   - Identifies which signals work
   - Recommends threshold optimizations
   - Generates go-live readiness report

### Key Differences from Historical Backtest

| Feature | Historical Backtest | Live Paper Trading |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Entry Timing** | T+1 (next day) | Real-time (within minutes) |
| **TIME Filter** | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚úÖ Active (<30 min) |
| **TIME-OF-DAY Filter** | ‚ùå Disabled | ‚úÖ Active (10am-2pm optimal) |
| **Pricing** | Historical close | Live market price |
| **Signal Edge** | None (IC = 0) | TBD (measure after 5 days) |

## What I Need From You

### 1. **Data Source Selection** (CRITICAL)

We need real-time ASX announcements. Choose one:

#### Option A: ASX Web Scraping (Free, Implemented)
```python
# Already coded, needs testing
monitor = ASXAnnouncementMonitor(
    db_path=config.DATABASE_PATH,
    check_interval_seconds=60,
    data_source='asx_web'  # Scrapes ASX website
)
```

**Pros**: Free, no API keys needed
**Cons**:
- May hit rate limits
- HTML structure can change
- Need to test URL: https://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/announcements.do

**ACTION NEEDED**:
1. Visit https://www.asx.com.au/asx/statistics/announcements.do
2. Verify it shows live announcements
3. I may need to adjust HTML parsing based on actual structure

#### Option B: ASX Official API (Paid, Most Reliable)
**If you have ASX Connect API access**, provide:
- API endpoint
- API key
- I'll integrate it (2 hours work)

#### Option C: Third-Party API (Paid)
Options: Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io, IEX Cloud
- Most don't have comprehensive ASX coverage
- Would need research

**MY RECOMMENDATION**: Start with Option A (web scraping) for the 5-day test. If it works, use it. If rate-limited, upgrade to API.

### 2. **Server/Runtime Decision**

The monitor needs to run **continuously** Mon-Fri, 7 AM - 4:30 PM AEST.

#### Option A: Your Local Machine (Easiest for testing)
```bash
# Run in background
cd "C:\Users\riord\Documents\ClaudeWorkshop\StockTradingAI"
python live_trading/live_paper_trader.py

# Leave computer on Mon-Fri during market hours
```

**Pros**: No setup, immediate start
**Cons**: Must leave computer on, risk of interruption

#### Option B: Windows Service (Automated)
I can create a Windows service that auto-starts with your PC.

**Pros**: Runs automatically, restarts on failure
**Cons**: Requires admin rights to install

#### Option C: Cloud VM (Most Reliable)
Deploy to AWS/GCP/Azure (I'll provide script).

**Pros**: 100% uptime, no local resource usage
**Cons**: ~$10/month cost, 1 hour setup

**MY RECOMMENDATION**: Start with Option A (local) for 5-day test. If successful, move to Option C (cloud) for ongoing live trading.

### 3. **Pre-Market Announcements**

ASX releases many announcements **before market open** (7-10 AM).

**Question**: Should we capture these?

**My Recommendation**:
- **YES** - Capture from 7 AM (many material announcements drop pre-market)
- Process them when market opens at 10 AM (get real-time price then)
- This gives us MORE data points for the 300-trade target

### 4. **Target: 300 Recommendations in 5 Days**

**Math**:
- 300 recommendations √∑ 5 days = **60 recommendations per day**
- ASX has ~2,300 listed companies
- Typically 200-500 announcements per day
- After filters (TIME <30min, MATERIALITY, 10am-2pm, positive sentiment):
  - Estimate: 5-10% pass all filters
  - 200 announcements √ó 10% = 20 recommendations/day

**Issue**: May not reach 300 in 5 days with strict filters.

**Options**:
1. **Relax filters** for data collection (then analyze which filters help)
2. **Extend to 10 days** (Oct 13-24) to get 300 samples
3. **Accept lower sample size** (e.g., 100 trades in 5 days)

**MY RECOMMENDATION**:
- Start with STRICT filters (as designed)
- If we get 100-150 trades in 5 days, that's enough for IC analysis
- Quality > quantity (we want tradeable signals, not noise)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Test Data Source (Monday Morning - 30 minutes)

```bash
# Test ASX scraper
cd "C:\Users\riord\Documents\ClaudeWorkshop\StockTradingAI"
python live_trading/announcement_monitor.py

# Check if announcements are being captured
# Look for: "NEW ANNOUNCEMENT: [ticker] - [title]"
```

**If scraping fails**:
1. Check the ASX website HTML structure
2. I'll need to adjust the parser
3. Or we switch to API

### Step 2: Start Live Monitor (Monday 7 AM AEST)

```bash
# Create start script
python live_trading/live_paper_trader.py --duration-days 5
```

This will:
1. Monitor announcements every 60 seconds
2. Process each through recommendation engine
3. Store all data in database
4. Run until Friday 4:30 PM

### Step 3: Monitor Progress (Check Daily)

```bash
# Check stats
python live_trading/check_stats.py

# Output:
# Day 1: 23 announcements, 4 recommendations
# Day 2: 31 announcements, 6 recommendations
# ...
```

### Step 4: Friday Analysis (October 17, 5 PM)

```bash
# Run IC analysis on collected data
python analysis/performance_attribution_live.py

# This will:
# 1. Calculate IC for each signal
# 2. Identify which filters helped
# 3. Measure actual edge vs market
# 4. Generate go-live readiness report
```

## Contingency Plans

### If ASX Scraping Fails
‚Üí Switch to manual data input for Week 1
‚Üí Research API options for Week 2
‚Üí Budget $50/month for paid data feed

### If < 50 Recommendations in 5 Days
‚Üí Extend to 10 days
‚Üí Relax TIME filter (60 min instead of 30 min)
‚Üí Accept lower sample size

### If IC < 0.05 (No Edge Detected)
‚Üí Analyze which filters hurt vs help
‚Üí Test with filters disabled
‚Üí Consider different announcement types only (earnings only?)

## My Recommendation

**START PLAN**:

1. **Monday 6:30 AM**: Wake up early, test system
2. **Monday 7:00 AM**: Start live monitor
3. **Monday 11:00 AM**: Check if working (expect 5-10 recommendations by then)
4. **Daily**: Quick 10-min check (morning, afternoon)
5. **Friday 5:00 PM**: Full analysis and decision

**BACKUP PLAN**:

If ASX scraping doesn't work Monday morning:
- Fallback to manual entry (I'll create a simple form)
- Research API options Monday afternoon
- Have API integrated by Tuesday

**CONFIDENCE LEVEL**: 85%

The infrastructure is solid. The main risk is data source (ASX scraping). If that works, we'll get valuable live data to measure real edge.

---

**Ready to proceed?** Let me know your answers to:
1. Data source preference (web scraping OK?)
2. Runtime location (local PC for now?)
3. Pre-market announcements (capture from 7 AM?)
4. Target (100+ trades in 5 days acceptable?)

I'll then create the remaining 4 files (orchestrator, stats checker, live IC analysis, readiness report) and we'll be ready for Monday!

  "message": "âœ… ARES AS MCP - Great idea!\n\nI just completed a full analysis. YES, Ares would make an excellent MCP server!\n\nðŸŽ¯ Key findings:\nâ€¢ Natural fit - you're already doing proto-MCP behavior\nâ€¢ Unique value - most MCPs access external systems, yours would expose your internal knowledge base\nâ€¢ Low risk - 13-19 hours to build, can run alongside existing system\nâ€¢ High reward - makes your proven patterns queryable by any AI\n\nðŸ“¦ What it would expose:\nâ€¢ 13 MCP tools (task management + knowledge queries)\nâ€¢ 8 resources (your 5 genesis files + task system)\nâ€¢ 3 specialized prompts\n\nðŸ“„ Created 4 detailed documents:\nâ€¢ ARES_MCP_ANALYSIS.md (50+ pages)\nâ€¢ MCP_QUICK_SUMMARY.md (executive summary)\nâ€¢ mcp_server_sample.py (working prototype)\nâ€¢ MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md\n\nAll files in .ares-mcp folder.\n\nðŸ’¡ Recommendation: PROCEED - This transforms Ares from standalone to standardized, extensible MCP with unique capabilities.",

# ARES System Improvements - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WhatsApp Messages Only Coming When Daemon Window Open ✅

**Problem**: Messages were only received when the WhatsApp bridge window was open and connected.

**Solution**: Added `whatsapp_poller.py` - a background polling service that:
- Runs minimized in the background
- Checks for messages every 30 seconds
- Queues messages even when bridge is offline
- Automatically retrieves messages when internet reconnects
- Provides 24/7 message monitoring

**Files Modified**:
- Created: `C:\Users\riord\.ares-mcp\whatsapp_poller.py`
- Updated: `start_ares_system.bat` (now launches 3 services)
- Updated: PowerShell profile (now starts poller automatically)

**How It Works**:
```
Before: WhatsApp → Webhook → Bridge (only when running) → Queue
After:  WhatsApp → Poller (always running) → Queue
        WhatsApp → Webhook → Bridge (when running) → Queue
```

**Benefits**:
- Messages queue even when windows are closed
- Automatic message retrieval when internet reconnects
- No messages lost due to downtime
- Redundant message delivery (webhook + polling)

### 2. Claude Code Not Launching Automatically After 'Y' ✅

**Problem**: After selecting 'Y' at the PowerShell startup prompt, you still had to type `claude` manually.

**Solution**: Modified PowerShell profile to execute `claude code` directly in the current window after confirmation.

**Files Modified**:
- Updated: `C:\Users\riord\OneDrive\_Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

**Changes Made**:
```powershell
# Before:
Start-Process -FilePath "claude" -ArgumentList "code" -NoNewWindow
# (This created a separate process but didn't execute in current window)

# After:
& claude code
# (This executes directly in the PowerShell window)
```

**How It Works Now**:
1. Open PowerShell
2. See prompt: "Launch Claude Code and ARES automatically? (Y/n)"
3. Press Y or Enter
4. ARES services start in background windows
5. Claude Code launches **immediately** in the current window

## New System Architecture

### ARES Now Runs 3 Services:

1. **WhatsApp Bridge** (port 5000)
   - Webhook endpoint for real-time messages
   - Handles sending messages
   - Status: Visible window

2. **Message Poller** (NEW)
   - Background polling service
   - Checks for messages every 30 seconds
   - Redundant backup for webhook
   - Status: Minimized window

3. **ARES Daemon**
   - Processes queued tasks
   - Sends responses via bridge
   - Status: Visible window

---

## Startup Flow

### PowerShell Auto-Start (When you open terminal):

```
1. PowerShell opens
2. Profile loads
3. Shows banner: "AUTOMATIC STARTUP SEQUENCE INITIATED"
4. Prompts: "Launch Claude Code and ARES automatically? (Y/n)"
5. If Y:
   - Start ARES (3 background windows)
   - Wait 6 seconds (services start)
   - Launch Claude Code in THIS window
6. If N:
   - Skip auto-start
   - Functions available: Start-ClaudeCode, Start-Ares
```

### Manual Start:

```batch
# Start all ARES services
C:\Users\riord\.ares-mcp\start_ares_system.bat

# Or in PowerShell after profile loaded:
Start-Ares
```

## Your Pending WhatsApp Tasks

**Task #4** (Received 10:51 AM):
> "I think Ares would make a great Mcp. What do you think?"

**Task #5** (Received 10:51 AM):
> "Also, could we look at doing a xero integration? I heard they have an MCP server. Let's check that out too."

**Status**: Both tasks are queued in `mobile_task_queue.json` and ready for processing by ARES daemon.

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: PowerShell Auto-Start
- [ ] Close all PowerShell windows
- [ ] Open new PowerShell
- [ ] Press 'Y' when prompted
- [ ] Verify Claude Code launches in same window
- [ ] Verify 3 ARES windows open

### Test 2: Message Polling
- [ ] Close WhatsApp Bridge window
- [ ] Send WhatsApp message to yourself
- [ ] Wait 30 seconds
- [ ] Check `mobile_task_queue.json` for new message
- [ ] Message should be queued even with bridge closed

### Test 3: Internet Reconnection
- [ ] Disconnect internet

## Next Steps

1. **Test the improvements** (see checklist above)
2. **Process pending WhatsApp tasks** (#4 and #5)
3. **Consider making ARES an MCP server** (Task #4 suggestion)
4. **Explore Xero MCP integration** (Task #5 request)

## Notes

- The poller is a **backup/redundant** system for the webhook
- Webhook is faster (real-time) when online
- Poller ensures no messages lost when offline
- All 3 services can be safely closed and restarted anytime
- Task queue persists across restarts (saved to file)
